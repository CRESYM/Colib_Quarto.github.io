It is the most common type of generators, and it is present in most power plants (thermal, hydro, and some wind) as an interface between the mechanical energy and electrical energy. The mathematical model presented in this article develops the dynamic equations of synchronous machines Doe (2100) It only covers the physical part of the machine (see Section 3) not the regulations nor protections schemes.",

For each component, is given: a brief explanation about the functioning of the component (how it works, what it is made of, which implementation choices are made) and the component equations or control diagram. The author can also point to another component page if the component is already explained in another page. In such case, he clearly needs to make coherence is achieved with the rest of the model in terms of notation, convention, and connection aspects.\n\nFor the equation system / algorithm : the author can use Latex language, which is fully compatible with markdown. He can also use numbered equations. The variables and parameters should be clearly specified, as well as their type (complex, real, etc.), unit (MW, MVA, etc), and meaning (phase to neutral voltage for the output terminal A). The notation should follow scientific standards.\nImages or Electric/Electronic/Control/Phasor diagramscan be added for clarity. The image must be of good quality and more preferably in .svg format. Diagrams can be used instead of equations to describe the component. The selected control blocks should be unambiguous, that is to say that their equations should be clearly understood from the diagram. A list of basic blocks can be found in colib here: pages/models/controlBlocks/. Several packages can be used to display diagrams, e.g.: draw.io plugin for github allows you to make your own diagram easily. The diagram is fully editable with github commit using a graphical interface, and allowing multiple format outputs (for more details, see: draw.io github). \nInitial equations/boundary conditions: when initial equations or boundary conditions are necessary to fully described the system, a subsection dedicated to those aspects can be added in this section.\n\nExample:\n\nPhysical description\nThe following schematic shows the components that participate in the synchronous machine operation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Synchronous machine\n\n\n\n[…]\n\n\nSynchronous machine equations\n\nVariables\n\n\n\nVariable\ndetails\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta_{shaft}\\)\nRotor angle\n\\(rad\\)\n\n\n\\(\\omega\\)\nElectrical rotational speed\n\\(rad/s\\)\n\n\n\\(T_m\\)\nMechanical torque\n\\(Nm\\)\n\n\n\\(T_e\\)\nElectrical torque\n\\(Nm\\)\n\n\n\n[…]\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(J\\)\nMoment of inertia\n\\(kgm^2\\)\n\n\n\\(p_f\\)\nNumber of pole pairs\n-\n\n\n\\(R_a\\), \\(R_b\\), \\(R_c\\)\nStator phase resistances\n\\(\\Omega\\)\n\n\n\n[…]\n\n\nSystem of equations\nThe following system of equations describe a general synchronous machine with the considered assumptions. Some of its parameters are generally non-constant, meaning it is not directly solved without making some additional assumptions. The particular models are derivations of this system of equations.\nThe equations Equation 1, Equation 2 represent the mechanical dynamic equations: \\[\nJ\\frac{2}{p_f}  \\frac{d\\omega_m}{dt} = T_m - T_e - T_{fw}\n\\tag{1}\\] \\[\\frac{d\\theta_{shaft}}{dt} = \\frac{2}{p_f} \\omega \\tag{2}\\]\n[…]",

    "section": "2 Writing principles",
    "text": "2 Writing principles\nDepending on the nature of the page, the model or the test case template should be used. in both cases, the writing principles are the same.\n\n2.1 Title\nPlease refer to chapter 2 part A of the (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023)\n\n\n2.2 Tags\nAll pages should contain tags, which are keywords provided by the author and that will automatically be detected by the search function of the website. The tags are listed after the tag keyword in the Markdown metadata block.\n\n\n2.3 Nomenclature\nWhen nomenclature is needed, it should appear in a decicated section of the page, preferably at the beginning of the page.\n\n\n2.4 Equations\nWhen the equation is at the beginning of an item, align the equal sign with the right-hand side capitals, end the equation with a period, begin the definition with a capital, and end with a period.\nWhen the equation is at the end of an item, end the definition with a comma, follow with an equal sign and the rest of the equation, then end with a period as shown in the following example.\nConsecutive Numbering: Equations within an article are numbered consecutively from the beginning of the article to the end. Appendix Equations: Continued consecutive numbering of equations is best in the Appendix, but equation numbering that starts over with (A1), (A2), etc., for Appendix equations is permissible.\nMaterial in displayed equations is automatically italic unless you indicate otherwise. Some simple general rules apply. All variables are italic. Function names and abbreviations are Roman, as are units, unit abbreviations, complete words, and abbreviations of words. Superscripts and subscripts follow this same formula: when they are variables, they are italic; when they are abbreviations of words (such as “in” and “out” for input and output), they are Roman. Single-letter superscripts and subscripts may be italic even if they are abbreviations, unless this leads to inconsistency between italic and Roman characters for similar types of subscripts.\n\n\n2.5 References\nPlease consult the decicated section on references and other types of Papers in (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.6 Text citation of Figures and Tables\nPlease consult the decicated section on text citations of Figures and Tables in (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.7 Other text\nPlease consult the decicated section on inclusive language, footnotes, and lists in text in (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.8 Writing style\nPlease consult the decicated section on : Acronyms, spelling, trademarks, plurals, hyphenation rules, grammar, contractions, capitalization, Dates, percentages and decimals, Ranges wit units in chapter E. Writing Style for Transactions in (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.9 Grammar and usage\nFor guidance in grammar and usage, please consult the (The Chicago Manual of Style 2017) and Chapter III. Grammer and usage in transactions from (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.10 Mathematical editing\nPlease consult the (IEEE Editing Mathematics 2023) for guidelines on how to write mathematics.\n\n\n2.11 Electrical and Electronics Terms, notations and conventions\nPlease consult the (“IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms” 1996) for the terms to be used in Electrical and Electronics fields.\nFor notations and conventions, please look at this page\nFor electrical and eletronic diagram, you can refer to (Graphic Symbols for Electrical and Electronics Diagrams 1993) and (“American National Standard - Supplement to Graphic Symbols for Electrical and Electronics Diagrams” 1986)\nFor control terminology, you can check: (Terminological Dictionary of Automatic Control, Systems and Robotics 2024)",

This type of model is often used in large-scale stability studies, for which it reflects the relevant phenomena. It is not a detailed physical model of the unit. Also for some stability phenomena (e.g. resonance stability) this model is not sufficient and EMT models or other approaches may be necessary .\nThe model operates only under the assumption that resistive and mechanical losses are negligible, and in steady state condition \\(P_{e} = P_{m}\\). This assumes that mechanical losses do not have any major effect on dynamic stability [1].",

    "text": "Model description\n\nTurbine model\nThe turbine model is the mechanical part of the model with boiler, high pressure (HP) turbine and low pressure (LP) turbine [4]. Its output is the mechanical power \\(P_{m}\\). A schematic representation of a steam turbine with HP and LP part is shown in Figure 2. The HP stage’s single-triangle symbol and the LP stage’s double-triangle symbol represent the fact that in the HP stage steam expands in only one direction whereas in the LP stage it expands in two directions [5].\n\nBoiler\nThe boiler is responsible for converting water into high-pressure, high-temperature steam. In normal operation \\(P_{set}\\) is used as the boiler set-point \\(P_{set,boiler}\\), i.e. the heat supplied to the boiler. In over speed situation, the emergency speed control signal is used instead, see Emergency speed control and intercept valve (IV) section.\nThe boiler output, i.e. the amount of steam supplied from the boiler to the turbine, is manipulated by the control valves [4].\n\n\nHigh-Pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) turbine stages\nThe HP and LP stages are modeled by a first order elements and gains \\(T_{hp}\\), \\(K_{hp}\\) and \\(T_{lp}\\), \\(K_{lp}\\).\nSteam power from the boiler enters the HP stage and is partly converted into mechanical power. The steam output from the HP stage then enters the reheater. Because the HP stage’s dynamic response is relevant here, the output of the \\(T_{hp}\\) lag element is used as input, but without the gain \\(K_{hp}\\).\nBefore entering the LP stage, the output steam from the HP stage must be reheated to prevent any water droplets from entering and to increase efficiency. The reheater is also modeled by a first order element with time constant \\(T_{rh}\\).\nFrom there the reheated steam passes the intercept valve and enters the LP stage. Here, the first order element directly contains the gain \\(K_{lp}\\), because only the generated power is of interest (the dynamic behaviour of the steam flow without gain is not necessary because there is no other following turbine stage) [4].\nThe mechanical power output \\(P_{m}\\) is the sum of the parts generated by the HP and LP turbine stages. To accurately represent this distribution, the gains for the HP and LP turbine stages must satisfy the following condition:\n\\[K_{hp} + K_{lp}  = 1\\]\n\n\n\nControl paths\nThe governor controller is responsible for regulating the steam flow to maintain the desired turbine speed or power output. It consists of two primary control paths [4], island and grid connected mode. They output the setpoint of the control valve’s position.\n\nIsland mode (\\(\\omega\\)-part)\nIn island mode, the input is the turbine’s rotational speed \\(\\omega\\). It operates without connection to any external power grid, with the primary goal of maintaining a constant turbine speed. To achieve this, the measured turbine speed \\(\\omega\\) is subtracted from the reference speed \\(\\omega_{ref}\\) to obtain the error signal \\(\\Delta\\omega\\). After passing the dead-band \\(\\Delta \\omega_{db}\\), it is used as input for the proportional \\(K_{\\omega,cor}\\) [4] [6].\nThe output of the island mode does not pass through the electrohydraulic transducer because it is an analog/mechanical controller, whereas the output of the PID controller of the grid connected mode is an electric signal.\n\n\nGrid connected mode (\\(f\\)-part)\nIn grid connected mode, the input is the measured electrical frequency \\(f\\). The plant is linked to an upstream grid and contributes to overall grid stability. Here, frequency control is achieved through collective behavior; individual output adjustments are made via droop regulation.\nThis is implemented via a proportional gain \\(K_{f,cor}\\) with dead-band \\(\\Delta f_{db}\\) contributing to the power set-point \\(P_{set}\\). The measured power \\(P_{e}\\) is then subtracted to obtain the error signal \\(\\Delta f\\) of the PID controller [4] [6].\n\n\nEmergency speed control and intercept valve (IV)\nEmergency speed control\nIn case of loss of loads, the turbine speed instantly begins to increase. Ideally, the governor is able to handle such fluctuations and reduces the control valve set-point fast enough. If not, an emergency speed control is activated to reduce the active power output of the turbine fast.\nThe Emergency Speed Control block in Figure 1 outputs 1 if \\(\\omega &lt; \\omega_{max,1}\\) and 0 if \\(\\omega &gt; \\omega_{max,2}\\). In-between it interpolates between 1 and 0. This output is supposed to be below 1 or equal to 0 if \\(\\omega\\) reaches dangerous levels (dangerous for mechanical stability of the turbine). It is then passed to the two different low value select blocks (min()).\nThis has the effect of reducing the control valve and boiler set-points (\\(P_{set,ctrl}\\), \\(P_{set,boiler}\\)) fast, independently of what the controllers and the power set-point \\(P_{set}\\) do.\nThis fast reduction of \\(P_{set,ctrl}\\) also affects the intercept valve model, see below.\nIntercept valve (IV)\nIntercept valves remain fully open (set-point and position = 1) for regular speed/load adjustments [4]. In overspeed situations, the intercept valve shall close quickly and then reopen once normal conditions are restored.\nIn this model, the intercept valve set-point is generated by the intercept valves set-point generation block. The input is the control valves input signal.\nIf the control valve set-point \\(P_{set,ctrl}\\) is above \\(P_{simx}\\), the output is 1. If \\(P_{set,ctrl}\\) drops below, the output is reduced linearly until it reaches 0. In other implementations, a step to 0 is used instead of linear reduction as shown in the Figure 1 from [1].\nIn combination with the emergency speed control block, this leads to a fast reduction of the intercept valve set-point in case of over speed and hence interrupting the steam flow into the LP turbine and quickly reducing \\(P_{m}\\).\n\n\n\nBoiler set-point and control valve set-point coordination\nWhen the power set-point \\(P_{set}\\) changes, it influences the feed-forward control of the boiler, which has a slow response time, and the PID controller that manages the control valve, which reacts more quickly. By implementing the control valve signal multiplication within the first-order element representing the boiler, the feed-forward and PID controls work in harmony rather than opposition, allowing the system to reach a steady state that reflects the new \\(P_{set}\\).",

It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version (Commission 2024). In previous standard versions (1992, 2005), its predecessor model was called AC1A. Compared to AC1A, AC1C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs and limits on the rotating exciter model.\nThis model is part of the alternator supplied rectifier excitation systems that use an ac alternator and stationary or rotating rectifies to produce generator field requirements.\n\n\n\nThese excitation systems consist of an alternator main exciter feeding its output via non-controlled rectifiers. The exciter does not employ self-excitation, and the voltage regulator power is taken from a source that is not affected by external transients.\nIt takes into account loading effects. It can’t allow the supply of negative field current. It takes into account saturation.\nThis model is satisfactory for large scale simulations. However, if this model is used to design phase lead networks for power system stabilizers, and the local mode is close to 3 Hz or higher, a more detailed treatment of the ac rotating exciter may be needed.\nExcitation systems incorporating rotating machines produce a field voltage output (\\(E_{FD}\\)) which is proportional to the rotating speed of the machine. Since this effect is negligible when speed deviations are small which is the case of dynamic studies of large interconnected power systems, the effect of speed deviations on the output of the dc rotating exciter models is not represented in this latest version of the standard.

A more detailed model is required to consider such effects, which are different in salient-pole machines (there is saturation in d-axis) and in round-rotor machines (the saturation is considered both in d and q axis, as there is no preferred direction for the flux).\nIt is not suitable for EMT studies as it does not consider the fast dynamics of the machine.",

    "text": "Operational principles\nThe general synchronous machine model contains the differential equations that completely model a round-rotor synchronous machine in the abc reference frame. In machines with salient poles rotors, the magnetic flux will have a preferred direction which will correspond to the salient part of the rotor. In the abc system, this preferred direction will be rotating alongside the rotor. This would translate in all the inductance values to be dependent on the position of the rotor as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{L}_{pp} = L_{pl} + L_{pp0} + L_{g2}\\cos(p_f\\theta_{shaft}) \\\\\n\\mathcal{L}_{pp'} = -\\frac{1}{2}L_{pp0} + L_{g2}\\cos(p_f\\theta_{shaft}) \\\\\n\\mathcal{L}_{pf} = \\mathcal{L}_{fp} = L_{pf}\\cos(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft} + \\phi_p)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwith \\(p\\) and \\(p'\\) being two differen phases, and \\(\\phi_p\\) being the associated displacement for each phase. Applying these new inductance values to the flux equations yield a much more complicated form that cannot be simplified (the complete flux equations can be seen in Kundur’s book [1]).\nIn order to have simpler equations for the salient poles machines (and simplify even more the previous round-rotor model), there is a transformation to a reference frame that rotates with the rotor called the dq0 reference frame, also called the Park transformation. This reference frame is formed by the direct axis (d), which is the polar axis in which the permeance to the magnetic field is greater than the permeance along the interpolar axis, called quadrature axis (q). In this reference frame, inductance expressions no longer are a function of the rotor position, yielding much simpler flux expressions.\nThe following diagram shows the convention for the reference frame as described in [6], which is the most common convention used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Salient pole synchronous machine schematic\n\n\n\nAs it can be seen, in addition to the field winding, the model considers three more windings \\[(1d, 1q, 2q)\\] that act as dampers, and do not have electrical connections. The transformation for stator currents is the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\begin{bmatrix} i_d \\\\\\ i_q \\\\\\ i_0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{2}{3} \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft}) & \\cos(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft} - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) & \\cos(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft} + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) \\\\\\ -\\sin(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft}) & -\\sin(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft} - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) & -\\sin(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft} + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) \\\\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} i_a \\\\\\ i_b \\\\\\ i_c \\end{bmatrix}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAn expression that is applicable to all the stator quantities such as voltage or flux. The zero-sequence current is always 0 in three-phase balanced conditions.\nThe transformation can be applied to the stator currents and fluxes equations from the general model while using the new inductance values. This derivation is omitted as it is laborious (it can be consulted in [1] or [5]). The flux expressions in the dq0 reference frame are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\psi_d = L_d i_d + L_{af} i_f \\\\\n\\psi_q = L_q i_q \\\\\n\\psi_f = \\frac{3}{2} L_{af} i_d + L_{ff} i_f \\\\\n\\psi_0 = L_0 i_0 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwith new inductance terms \\(L_d = L_{al} + \\frac{3}{2}(L_{aa0} + L_{g2})\\), \\(L_q = L_{al} + \\frac{3}{2}(L_{aa0} - L_{g2})\\) and \\(L_0 = L_{al}\\), all of them independent from the rotor position in this reference frame.\nNow, the voltage equations for the dq0 reference frame are also transformed into:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_d = R_a i_d + \\frac{d\\psi_d}{dt} - \\omega \\psi_q \\\\\nv_q = R_a i_q + \\frac{d\\psi_q}{dt} + \\omega \\psi_d \\\\\nv_0 = R_a i_0 + \\frac{d\\psi_0}{dt}\\\\\nv_f = R_f i_f + \\frac{d\\psi_f}{dt}\\\\\nv_{1d} = R_{1d} i_{1d} + \\frac{d\\psi_{1d}}{dt}\\\\\nv_{1q} = R_{1q} i_{1q} + \\frac{d\\psi_{1q}}{dt}\\\\\nv_{2q} = R_{2q} i_{2q} + \\frac{d\\psi_{2q}}{dt}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe expressions for instantaneous power and torque in this reference frame are [1]:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np_s (t) = \\frac{3}{2}(v_d i_d + v_q i_q + 2v_0 i_0)\\\\\nT_{mech} = \\frac{3}{2}(\\psi_d i_q + \\psi_q i_d)\\frac{p_f}{2}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe full model of the synchronous generation can be written in a per-unit system as defined in Sauer and Pai book [6]. Firstly, the displacement with respect to the synchronous speed is defined as \\(\\delta = \\frac{p_f}{2} \\theta_{shaft} - \\omega_s t\\), where \\(\\omega_s = 2\\pi f\\) is the synchronous speed. If the rotor is rotating at the same speed as the grid, this angle will be constant. The displacement is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d\\delta}{dt} = \\omega_m - \\omega_s\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThen, all the variables are scaled with respect to the rated values as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_{abc} = \\frac{v_{abc}}{V_{BABC}}\\\\\nI_{abc} = \\frac{-i_{abc}}{I_{BABC}}\\\\\n\\Psi_{abc} = \\frac{\\psi_{abc}}{\\psi_{BABC}}\\\\\nV_{dq0} = \\frac{v_{dq0}}{V_{BDQ}}\\\\\nI_{dq0} = \\frac{-i_{dq0}}{I_{BDQ}}\\\\\n\\Psi_{dq0} = \\frac{\\psi_{dq0}}{\\psi_{BDQ}}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(V_{BABC}\\) and \\(V_{BDQ}\\) are the rated RMS phase to neutral voltage and peak phase to neutral voltage respectively, \\(I_{ABC} = \\frac{S_B}{3V_{ABC}}\\), \\(I_{BDQ} = \\frac{2S_B}{3V_{BDQ}}\\) with \\(S_{B}\\) the rated three-phase apparent power, and \\(\\psi_{BABC} = \\frac{V_{BABC}}{\\omega_B}\\), \\(\\psi_{BDQ} = \\frac{V_{BDQ}}{\\omega_B}\\) with \\(\\omega_B = \\omega_s\\).\nThe rest of parameters can also be scaled as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nR_{a} = \\frac{r_{a}}{Z_{BDQ}}\\\\\nR_{f} = \\frac{r_{f}}{Z_{BFD}}\\\\\nR_{1d} = \\frac{r_{1d}}{Z_{B1D}}\\\\\nR_{1q} = \\frac{r_{1q}}{Z_{B1Q}}\\\\\nR_{2q} = \\frac{r_{2q}}{Z_{B2Q}}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSimilar transformations can be performed over the rotor and stator inductances, which can be consulted in Sauer and Pai book [6], Sections 3.3 and 3.4.\nThe resulting equations for the synchronous machine model in the dq0 reference frame describe the GENSAL synchronous machine model without saturation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{\\omega_s} \\frac{d\\Psi_d}{dt} = R_s I_d + \\frac{\\omega_m}{\\omega_s} \\psi_q + V_d\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\omega_s} \\frac{d\\Psi_q}{dt} = R_s I_q - \\frac{\\omega_m}{\\omega_s} \\psi_d + V_q\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\omega_s} \\frac{d\\Psi_0}{dt} = R_s I_0 + V_0\\\\\nT'_{d0} \\frac{dE'_q}{dt} = -E'_q - (X_d - X'_d)[I_d - \\frac{X'_d - X''_d}{(X'_d - X_{ls})^2} (\\Psi_{1d} + (X'_d - X_{ls})I_d - E'_q)] + E_{fd}\\\\\nT''_{d0} \\frac{d\\Psi_{1d}}{dt} = -\\Psi_{1d} + E'_q - (X'_d - X_{ls})I_d\\\\\nT'_{q0} \\frac{dE'_d}{dt} = -E'_d + (X_q - X'_q)[I_q - \\frac{X'_q - X''_q}{(X'_q - X_{ls})^2} (\\Psi_{2q} + (X'_q - X_{ls})I_q + E'_d)]\\\\\nT''_{q0} \\frac{d\\Psi_{2q}}{dt} = -\\Psi_{2q} - E'_d - (X'_q - X_{ls})I_q\\\\\n\\frac{d\\delta}{dt} = \\omega_m - \\omega_s\\\\\n\\frac{2H}{\\omega_s} \\frac{d\\omega_m}{dt} = T_m - (\\Psi_d I_q - \\Psi_q I_d) - T_{fw}\\\\\n\\Psi_d = -X''_d I_d + (\\frac{X'_d - X_{ls}}{X'_d - X_{ls}}) E'_q + (\\frac{X'_d - X''_d}{X'_d - X_{ls}}) \\Psi_{1d}\\\\\n\\Psi_q = -X''_q I_q - (\\frac{X'_q - X_{ls}}{X'_q - X_{ls}}) E'_d + (\\frac{X'_q - X''_q}{X'_q - X_{ls}}) \\Psi_{2q}\\\\\n\\Psi_0 = -X_{ls} I_0\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]",

    "text": "Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations\nThe model is used to perform transient stability analysis of synchronous machines, providing a more accurate representation of the physical machine. It considers that there exists saturation in the iron of the machine, and it is applied to all the inductive terms simultaneously, differently to what the GENROU/GENSAL models with additive saturation consider. Following a recommendation note from the North-America Electrical Reliability Corporation (NERC) [4], the GENTPJ is overall recommended for all the synchronous machines as it recognizes the effect of the stator current in saturation. The GENROU, GENSAL and GENTPF (the latter being exactly identical to the GENTPJ except an additive term in the saturation function) may induce significant error specially in simulations where reactive power support is considered.\nThe model assumptions are the following:\n\nThe three-phase system is balanced.\nThe air gap between the stator and rotor is non-uniform, but the relationships between the flux linkages and currents are independent of the position of the rotor when expressed in the dq0 reference frame.\nThe magnetic circuit is considered to be non-linear, considering saturation effects, and can be modeled using different saturation functions.\nThe saturation effects are applied to the subtransient reactances, but not at the transient and steady-state reactances.\n\nThe GENTPJ model is suitable for EMT as it models with detail the non-linearities and the fast dynamics of the machine. However, the saturation effects are only applied to the subtransient reactances. Newer models consider saturation in more reactances of the machine, improving GENTPF and GENTPJ models. GENTPJ will be deprecated in December 2024, and substituted by the GENQEC [5], although this later model is still in testing process [6].",

    "text": "Operational principles\n\nModelling saturation\nTo model the saturation, there are three commonly used functions:\n\nQuadratic: \\[ Sat(x) = B(x-A)^2\\]. Used in GE PSLF and PowerWorld Simulator.\nScaled Quadratic: \\[ Sat(x) = \\frac{B(x-A)^2}{x}\\]. Used in PTI PSS/E and PowerWorld Simulator.\nExponential: \\[ Sat(x) = Bx^A\\]. Used in BPA-IPF nad some specific models of PTI PSS/E and PowerWorld Simualtor.\n\nIn this case, the variable will be the magnetic flux and, for the GENTPJ, the currents \\(I_d\\) and \\(I_q\\).\n\n\nDifference between GENTPF and GENTPJ\nThe model presented has two different approaches to include the saturation, which results in two slightly different models, the GENTPF and the GENTPJ. The only difference is an additive term that models the effect of the field current. The following equations are used to calculate the saturation over the q and d axis:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nSat_d = 1 + Sat(\\Psi_{ag} + K_{is}\\sqrt(I_d^2 + I_q^2))\\\\\nSat_q = 1 + \\frac{X_q}{X_d}Sat(\\Psi_{ag} + K_{is}\\sqrt(I_d^2 + I_q^2))\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(K_{is}\\) is a given parameter that models the stator current effect. In the GENTPF, \\(K_{is} = 0\\), disregarding the effect to simplify the model, while the GENTPJ, with \\(K_{is} \\ne 0\\), is the more complete model and generally the one recommended using in transient stability studies.\nThis saturation factor will be used to multiply the flux values or to divide the reactance values.\n\n\nTransformation of the GENSAL model\nStarting form the GENSAL equations, the GENTPJ model is derived with detail in the PowerWorld document [3]. The most important aspects are covered in this section.\n\n\nSubtransient reactances\nWhen adding saturation in the GENSAL model, it is necessary to set \\[X_d'' = X_q''\\] to avoid transient saliency and then having a simple circuit equation could be used to model the grid connection. It was convenient to simplify the models back in the days, but it did not model properly the real behavior of the synchronous machine.\nFor the GENTPF/GENTPJ, generally \\[ X_d'' \\ne X_q''\\], which results in some more complex equations, but it allows to consider the impact of the transient saliency. The following expressions are used to calculate the saturated values of the reactances:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nX_{dsat}'' = \\frac{X_d'' - X_l}{Sat_d} + X_l \\\\\nX_{qsat}'' = \\frac{X_q'' - X_l}{Sat_q} + X_l \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nNetwork interface equations\nThe following circuit equations were obtained in the GENSAL model:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{\\omega_s} \\frac{d\\Psi_d}{dt} = R_s I_d + \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s} \\Psi_q + V_d\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\omega_s} \\frac{d\\Psi_q}{dt} = R_s I_q - \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s} \\Psi_d + V_q\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWith proper transformations using the expressions for the fluxes, they can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_d = - R_s I_d +  X_q''I_q + E_d''\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s}\\\\\nV_q = - R_s I_q -  X_d''I_d + E_q''\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwith \\[E_d'' = E'_d \\frac{X_q'' - X_l}{X_q' - X_l} + \\Psi_q'' \\frac{X_q' - X_q\"}{X_q' - X_l}\\], and \\[E_q'' = E'_q \\frac{X_d'' - X_l}{X_d' - X_l} + \\Psi_d'' \\frac{X_d' - X_d\"}{X_d' - X_l}\\], and where the scaling \\(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s}\\) is ommited for the subtransient reactances. As discussed for the GENSAL model, \\(X_d'' = X_q''\\), which allows to compact the grid interface equations in a single equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_d + jV_q = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s} (E_d'' + jE_q'') - (R_s + jX_d'') (I_d + jI_q) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is not doable in the GENTPJ model, since generally the subtransient reactances are not equal. In this case, the saturated values of the subtransient reactance are used:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nV_d = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s} E_d'' + I_q X_{qsat}'' - I_dR_a\\\\\nV_q = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s} E_q'' - I_d X_{dsat}'' - I_qR_a\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAgain, the frequency factor can be added to the term \\(I_q X_{qsat}''\\) and \\(I_d X_{dsat}''\\), but it is commonly omitted in transient stability studies.\nThe following figure shows the block diagram for this GENTPJ model [3]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Block diagram of the GENTPJ model",

It is specially useful in applications where there are fast-transients to be studied, being able to describe phenomena ranging from short-circuits to switching events or even lightning [1].\nThe assumptions made are:\n\nThe DC side of the converter is considered as an ideal DC voltage source \\(E_{DC}\\).\nThe AC-side of the converter is connected to the grid through an AC filter formed by a resistance \\(R\\) and an inductance \\(L\\). The AC voltage in the converter side is \\(v_{c}^{abc}\\).\nThe system is considered to be balanced, and the positive and negative sequence are not considered.\nThe synchronization with the grid is controlled by a PLL, and it is done by imposing that the \\(v_d = 0\\). This design criteria allows to relate active and reactive power with one of the components of the current. It only considers the fundamental frequency.\nThe VSC is assumed to be a 2-level converter, meaning that there are 2 IGBTs per phase.\n\nAlthough it can be used for low-frequency phenomena such as transient stability or inter-area oscillations, the number of calculations to capture the dynamics is much greater than Phasor models, and result in much higher execution times.

    "text": "Model description\nThe model can be described with the following schematic:\n\n\n\nEMT GF VSC scheme\n\n\n\nFigure 1: EMT Grid Following VSC scheme [1]\n\nAs it can be seen, there are several control blocks that act over the converter to determine the operating point. For a Grid Following VSC, these are:\n\nThe Clarke/Park transformation blocks, which convert the electrical variables into the \\(\\alpha\\beta\\) and qd0 reference frames.\nThe Phase-Lock Loop (commonly referred to as PLL), which tracks the grid voltage and synchronizes the converter with the grid angle.\nThe Outer Loop, which provides active and reactive power control by setting a current reference from a power reference.\nThe Inner Loop, or Current Loop, which corrects the converter voltage to provide the reference current.\nThe modulation block, which in more simplified models is not applied. In the case of the present model, since other harmonic elements are not considered, it can be omitted.\n\nA detailed explanation of each block is provided in the following subsections.\n\nClarke and Park transformations\nAssuming a three-phase balanced system, the electrical variables can be expressed in the abc reference frame as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{abc} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_a \\\\ x_b \\\\ x_c \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{2} X \\cos(\\theta) \\\\ \\sqrt{2}X \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) \\\\ \\sqrt{2}X \\cos(\\theta + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(X\\) is the amplitude of the voltage or current, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of the voltage or current. The Clarke transformation [4] is used to convert the three-phase variables into an orthogonal reference frame. The transformation matrix is given by:\n\\[\nT_{\\text{Clarke}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & \\sqrt{3} & -\\sqrt{3} \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwhich applied to the abc variables in balanced conditions, results in the \\(\\alpha\\beta0\\) variables:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{\\alpha\\beta0} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{\\alpha} \\\\ x_{\\beta} \\\\ x_0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{2} X \\cos(\\theta) \\\\ - \\sqrt{2}X \\sin(\\theta)  \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nnoting that \\(x_0 = 0\\) since it is a balanced system. The electrical variables in this new reference are still sinusoidal. It is desirable to have constant valued variables to be able to implement typical PI control over the signal more easily. This is done using the Park transformation [5], converting the \\(\\alpha\\beta\\) variables into a rotating reference frame. The transformation matrix is given by:\n\\[\nT_{\\text{Park}}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\hat{\\theta}) & -\\sin(\\hat{\\theta}) \\\\ \\sin(\\hat{\\theta}) & \\cos(\\hat{\\theta}) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwhich applied to the \\(\\alpha\\beta\\) variables, results in the \\(dq0\\) variables:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{qd0} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{q} \\\\ x_{d} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{2} X \\cos(\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})  \\\\ \\sqrt{2} X \\sin(\\theta - \\hat{\\theta}) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAs it can be seen, the Park transformation is dependent of the angle \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), which is the angle of the rotating reference frame, and it can be different to the angle of the voltage \\(\\theta\\). If the electrical variable is synchronized with the rotating reference frame, then \\(\\theta = \\hat{\\theta}\\) and \\(x_d = 0\\).\n\n\nPLL\nThe goal of the PLL is to track the grid frequency and angle, as it is needed to establish the operating points of the converter using the control loops. The design of this controller is detailed in [6]. As stated earlier, when the voltage is synchronized with the reference frame (in this case, the grid), \\(v_d = 0\\). To perform this tracking, the control applied considers a PI controller, yielding the following control structure:\n\n\n\nPLL Control Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 2: PLL Control Diagram [3]\n\nUsing the Park transformation over the grid measured voltages, and assuming a small phase difference between the output of the converter and the grid voltage, the linearization \\(v^g_d = E_m \\sin(\\delta) \\approx E_m \\delta\\) can be applied in order to simplify the closed-loop transfer function for the tunning of the controller. \\(E_m\\) is the peak value of the grid voltage and \\(\\delta = \\theta - \\hat{\\theta}\\) is the angle difference between the measured and the reference frame angle. The linearized control structure is the following:\n\n\n\nPLL Control Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Linearized PLL Control Diagram\n\nNow, the PI controller needs to be tuned in order to provide the desired response. The following closed-loop transfer function models the response of the PLL:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}(s)}{\\theta(s)}  = \\frac{2 \\zeta \\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2} {s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n + \\omega_n^2}\n\\]\nwhich corresponds to a second-order response, where \\(\\hat{\\theta}(s)\\) is the estimated grid angle, \\(\\theta(s)\\) is the voltage angle, \\(\\zeta\\) is the damping factor, \\(\\omega_n\\) is the natural frequency. The PI controller block function is given by:\n\\[\nG_{PI}(s) = K_p + \\frac{K_i}{s} = k_p \\frac{1 + s\\tau_{PLL}}{s\\tau_{PLL}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(k_p\\) and \\(\\tau_{PLL}\\) denoting the gains of the proportional gain and the PLL time constant, respectively. These parameters can be computed using the following expressions, obtained after working with the expressions of the closed loop transfer functions:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega_n &= \\sqrt{\\frac{k_p E_m}{\\tau_{PLL}}} \\\\\n\\zeta &= \\frac{\\sqrt{\\tau_{PLL} k_p E_m}}{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nA typical value for the damping ratio is \\(\\zeta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), PLL natural frequency could be set to a given frequency (i.e, 50 Hz, or 1 kHz), depending on the desired response (the higher the frequency, the more aggressive). It is a choice of the user to set the desired values of the controller, setting exactly two of the four parameters (\\(\\omega_n\\), \\(\\tau_{PLL}\\), \\(\\zeta\\), \\(k_p\\)). The peak voltage \\(E_m\\) is a parameter given by the utility characteristics.\n\n\nCurrent control\nThe current control is used to determine the converter voltage that has to be applied in order to maintain the current at the setpoint. The model presented uses the Internal Model Control method (IMC), described in [7], which provides PI controllers tuned in terms of the machine parameters (in this case \\(R\\) and \\(L\\)) with the desired response. The control is based on the electric relationship between the variables:\n\\[\nv_{c}^{abc} - v_{g}^{abc} = R i_c^{abc} + L \\frac{d}{dt} i_c^{abc}\n\\]\nwhich can be transformed into the qd frame to obtain the following equation:\n\\[\nv_{c}^{qd} - v_{g}^{qd} =\\begin{bmatrix} R & L \\omega\\\\ -L \\omega & R \\end{bmatrix} i_c^{qd} + L \\frac{d}{dt} i_c^{qd}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency of the grid obtained in the PLL, and \\(v_{g}^d = 0\\). The block diagram associated to this system is the following:\n\n\n\nCurrent Control Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Current Control Diagram [3]\n\nAs it can be seen, there is a coupling between the q and d components. This can be dealt by the controller by designing a two dimension controller, or by decoupling the components and independently controlling each component. The later approach is the chosen in this model, using the following expression:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\hat{v}^{q} \\\\ \\hat{v}^{d} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_{c}^{q} - v_g^{q} + L\\omega i_d  \\\\ v_{c}^{d} - L\\omega i_q \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{v}^{q}\\) and \\(\\hat{v}^{d'}\\) are the controller output voltages. The equations are now decoupled using the expression:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\hat{v}^{q} \\\\ v^{d} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} R & 0\\\\ 0 & R \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} i_q \\\\ i_d \\end{bmatrix} + L \\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{bmatrix}  i_q \\\\ i_d \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nApplying the Laplace transformation and reordering, the following relation holds:\n\\[\n\\frac{i^{qd}(s)}{\\hat{v}^{qd}(s)} = \\frac{1}{R + sL}\n\\]\nThe following schematic represents the closed-loop block diagram for the current loop:\n\n\n\nCurrent Error Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Current Error Diagram\n\nThe transfer function of this block diagram, considering \\(G_c = K^{icl}_p + \\frac{K^{icl}_i}{s}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{i^{qd}(s)}{i^{qd*}(s)} = \\frac{G_c(s)}{Ls + R + G_c(s)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(i^{qd*}(s)\\) is the reference current for q or d axis, \\(i^{qd}(s)\\) is the measured current. The controller gains can be selected as \\(K^{icl}_p = \\frac{L}{\\tau_c}\\) and \\(K^{icl}_i = \\frac{R}{\\tau_c}\\), where \\(\\tau_c\\) is the time constant of the current loop, such that the complete closed-loop transfer function is represented as the following first-order response:\n\\[\n\\frac{i^{qd}(s)}{i^{qd*}(s)} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_c s + 1}\n\\]\nThe resulting PI controller is the following:\n\\[\nG_{c}(s) = K_p + \\frac{K_i}{s} = \\frac{L}{\\tau_c} + \\frac{R}{\\tau_c s}\n\\]\nThe converter voltage setpoint obtained from this loop (\\(v_c^{qd}\\)) is then used to modulate the IGBT pulses and generate the AC voltage from the DC source. However, the modulation block can be omitted in some simplified models such as this one, and it can be considered to be directly the actual converter voltage, maintaining the notation without the setpoint indicator (\\(*\\)).\n\n\nActive and reactive power control\nThe previous section made use of the current setpoints to control the converter. These setpoints can be determined directly by the user, or they can be obtained from the power setpoints (\\(P^*\\), \\(Q^*\\)), which would still come from the user. To derive the controls, firstly the instantaneous power theory [8] is described briefly for the synchronous frame dq0.\nThe voltage and current phasors can be expressed in the dq0 frame as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv^{qd} &= \\frac{v^q - jv^d}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\ni^{qd} &= \\frac{i^q - ji^d}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe complex power phasor, as well as the active and reactive power values, can now be obtained with:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\underline{S} &= 3 v^{qd}(i^{qd})^* = 3 (\\frac{v^q - jv^d}{\\sqrt{2}})(\\frac{i^q + ji^d}{\\sqrt{2}})\\\\\nP &= \\Re(S) = \\frac{3}{2} (v^q i^q + v^d i^d) \\\\\nQ &= \\Im(S) = \\frac{3}{2} (v^q i^d - v^d i^q)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAs a design choice of the PLL, \\(v_d = 0\\) to track the grid angle. Then, the expressions for current setpoints can be extracted substituting in the previous equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ni^{q*} &= \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{P^*}{v^q} \\\\\ni^{d*} &= \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{Q^*}{v^d}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis relationship can be used to calculate directly the current setpoint for a given value of \\(v^q\\), which could be considered constant if the grid voltage is stable, or it can come directly from the voltage measurements. However, it is not robust when there are transient phenomena or perturbations in the grid voltage. To have a smoother response, a power loop is designed to control the current setpoints using a PI controller. The following block diagram represents the open-loop power control:\n\n\n\nPower Control Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Power Control Diagram [3]\n\nIn order to tune the PI controller parameters, the closed-loop of the system is considered. In order to have the feedback loop, the power output is calculated including the current loop dynamics and the conversion from current to power using the instantaneous power theory. The following block diagram shows the complete power loop:\n\n\n\nError power loop\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Closed-Loop Power Control Diagram\n\nAs it can be seen, the peak voltage is used as it assumes that the deviations with respect to the nominal will be small, and this is only to have an appropriate tuning of the controller.\nFollowing a similar procedure to the one of the current loop, the closed-loop transfer function of the power loop can be modelled as a first-order system:\n\\[\n\\frac{P(s)}{P^*(s)} = \\frac{Q(s)}{Q^*(s)} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_p s + 1}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\tau_p\\) is the time constant of the power loop. The PI controller can be obtained with the use of the time constant of the current loop as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nK^{ipl}_p &= \\frac{2\\tau_c}{3V_{peak}\\tau_p} \\\\\nK^{ipl}_i &= \\frac{2}{3V_{peak}\\tau_p}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe time constant \\(\\tau_p\\) will be larger than \\(\\tau_c\\), since the power loop is designed to have a slower response than the current loop.\n\n\nLimitations of current and anti-windup control\nThe physical limitations of the converter have to be included in the modelling, in order to simulate the saturation of current and voltage. This allows the simulation of faults using this model.\nTo avoid overshooting the current or voltages, an anti-windup control is added to the PI controllers present in the model. The proposed controller is based on the tracking of the difference between the output of the PI controller and the saturation limit [10]. The control signal is then modified to avoid the overshooting. The block diagram of the anti-windup control is the following:\n\n\n\nAnti-Windup Control Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Anti-Windup Control Diagram\n\nwith a gain \\(G\\) between 0 and 1.\nAn alternative approach to implement this anti-windup control is detailed in [11], where the integral part of the controller is substituted by a low-pass filter that follows the PI signal. The following block diagram shows the implementation of this alternative anti-windup control:\n\n\n\nAnti-Windup Control Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Alternative Anti-Windup Control Diagram\n\nWhere \\(\\tau_{i} = \\frac{K_p}{K_i}\\).\nTo decide the saturation limits for the current components, the operation mode of the converter has to be considered, which will determine which current component is prioritized. These operation modes are typically defined by the grid codes, although a possible implementation could be the following:\n\nNormal operation: The converter will follow the \\(i^q\\) component setpoint, prioritizing the active power, and then \\(i^d\\) will be limited by the operational limits of the converter \\(i^d_{max} = \\sqrt{I_{max}^2 - \\max{(i^q, i^{q*})}^2}\\).\nTransient or fault operation: The converter will now prioritize the \\(i^d\\) component, which will follow its reference, and \\(i^q_{max} = \\sqrt{I_{max}^2 - \\max{(i^d, i^{d*})}^2}\\).",

It is represented as three current sources with magnitude and angle defined by the control system.\nThe system is considered to be balanced, and the positive and negative sequence are not considered.\nThe electrical variables are represented by phasors that rotate at the synchronous frequency of the grid in steady-state or quasi-steady-state.\nThe complete control structure from the EMT Model, apart from the PLL, is preserved. Further simplifications are made in the models that derive from the Full-Phasor model.\n\nThe model has its limitations when performing high-frequency domain phenomena (\\(&gt;1\\) kHz), as all the fast-dynamics are not considered since it uses algebraic equations instead of the differential equations that are used on the EMT model. It is not useful either to calculate unbalanced situation as the model is based on the positive sequence.\nFrom this model, some approximations can be made to reduce the complexity of the model and speed up the simulation if the study to be performed does not require to cover some dynamics of the converter.

    "text": "Model description\nThe model can be described with the following schematic:\n\n\n\nphasor GF VSC scheme\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Phasor Grid Following VSC scheme [2]\n\nThe main blocks of the model are: * The angle and frequency tracking block, which substitutes the PLL of the EMT model. * The Outer Loop, which provides active and reactive power control by setting a current reference from a power reference. * The Inner Loop, or Current Loop, which corrects the converter voltage to provide the reference current. * The transformation blocks, which transform the electrical variables from abc into qd0 and viceversa.\nA detailed explanation of each block is provided in the following subsections.\n\nTransformation blocks\nSince we are dealing with phasors that rotate at the grid frequency, instead of instantaneous values, the transformation from the abc reference frame to the qd0 reference frame can be performed by cancelling or applying the rotation of the phasor.\nAssuming we have a complex electrical variable \\(x = Xe^{j\\theta}\\), where \\(X\\) is the amplitude and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of the variable, the transformation to the qd0 reference can be done by multiplying by \\(e^{-j\\theta_v}\\).\nFor the abc variables, the phasors will be:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{abc} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_a \\\\ x_b \\\\ x_c \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} Xe^{j\\theta} \\\\ Xe^{j(\\theta - \\frac{2\\pi}{3})} \\\\ Xe^{j(\\theta + \\frac{2\\pi}{3})} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(X\\) is the amplitude of the voltage or current, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of the voltage or current. Since the system is balanced, the transformation can be calculated using the \\(a\\)-phase measurement, and \\(\\theta_v = \\theta\\). The real and imaginary parts of the product of \\(v_a e^{-j\\theta_v}\\) will give the \\(v^q\\) and \\(v^d\\) components of the voltage, respectively.\nIn case of unbalance system, the method of symmetrical components would have to be used in order to obtain the positive an negative sequence components.\nInversely, the transformation from qd0 reference frame to abc can be done by performing the following operation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv^a &= (v^q + j v^d)e^{j\\theta_v} \\\\\nv^b &= v^a e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{3}} \\\\\nv^c &= v^a e^{j\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nAngle and frequency tracking\nInstead of having a PLL, the direct measurement of the voltage of the grid will provide its angle \\(\\theta\\). The frequency of the grid is obtained by differentiating the angle, using the value of the angle of the previous iteration (or \\(\\theta_0\\) for the first time step) and the current value, as well as the time step:\n\\[\n\\omega = \\frac{\\theta_i - \\theta_{i-1}}{\\Delta t}\n\\]\nThis tracking, alongside the transformations mentioned in the previous section, can be represented by the following block diagram:\n\n\n\nAngle Tracking Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Angle Tracking and dq0 Transformation Diagram\n\nThe dynamics of the grid tracking are completely dismissed using this approach, which has led to some developments in order to simulate these dynamics using the closed-loop transfer function [6]:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\theta_v'(s)}{\\theta_v(s)} = \\frac{s \\tau_{pll} + 1}{\\frac{s^2}{\\omega_{pll}^2} + s\\tau_{pll} + 1}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\tau_{pll}\\) is the time constant of the PLL and \\(\\omega_{pll}\\) is the natural frequency of the PLL. This dynamics can be omitted by considering \\(\\theta_v'(s) = \\theta_v(s)\\).\n\n\nCurrent control\nThe same current control as in the EMT model is used to determine the converter voltage that has to be applied in order to maintain the current at the setpoint. The model uses the Internal Model Control method (IMC), described in [7], which provides PI controllers tuned in terms of the machine parameters (in this case \\(R\\) and \\(L\\)) with the desired response. The control is based on the following block diagram:\n\n\n\nCurrent Control Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Current Control Diagram [3]\n\nThe RL filter has been used so the dynamics of the current loop are the same as in the EMT model, described by the Laplace transform of the voltage and current relationships:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ni^{q*}_c &= \\frac{v^{q*}_c - v^{q}_g - \\omega_g L i^d_c}{R + sL} = \\frac{\\hat{v}^q}{R + sL}\\\\\ni^{d*}_c &= \\frac{v^{d*}_c - v^{d}_g + \\omega_g L i^q_c}{R + sL} = \\frac{\\hat{v}^d}{R + sL}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(v^{q*}_c\\) and \\(v^{d*}_c\\) are the setpoints of the converter voltage, \\(v^{q}_g\\) and \\(v^{d}_g\\) are the grid voltage measurements, \\(i^{q*}_c\\) and \\(i^{d*}_c\\) are the setpoints of the converter current, and \\(i^{q}_c\\) and \\(i^{d}_c\\) are the converter current measurements. Although \\(i^{qd*}_c\\) is directly considered to be the converter current without any modulation, a different notation for its measurement is used (\\(i^{qd}_c\\)) to differentiate it.\nThe open-loop transfer function is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{i^{qd*}_c(s)}{\\hat{v}^{qd}(s)} = \\frac{1}{R + sL}\n\\]\nThe following schematic represents the closed-loop block diagram for the current loop:\n\n\n\nCurrent Error Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Current Error Diagram\n\nThe transfer function of this block diagram, considering \\(G_c = K^{icl}_p + \\frac{K^{icl}_i}{s}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{i^{qd*}_c(s)}{i^{qd*}(s)} = \\frac{G_c(s)}{Ls + R + G_c(s)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(i^{qd*}(s)\\) is the reference current for q or d axis, \\(i^{qd*}_c(s)\\) is the converter current. The controller gains can be selected as \\(K^{icl}_p = \\frac{L}{\\tau_c}\\) and \\(K^{icl}_i = \\frac{R}{\\tau_c}\\), where \\(\\tau_c\\) is the time constant of the current loop, such that the complete closed-loop transfer function is represented as the following first-order response:\n\\[\n\\frac{i^{qd*}_c(s)}{i^{qd*}(s)} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_c s + 1}\n\\]\nThe resulting PI controller is the following:\n\\[\nG_{c}(s) = K_p + \\frac{K_i}{s} = \\frac{L}{\\tau_c} + \\frac{R}{\\tau_c s}\n\\]\nThe converter voltage setpoint obtained from this loop (\\(v_c^{qd*}\\)) can be used to determine the current of the equivalent sources of the converters when used in the relationship for \\(i^{q*}_c\\) and \\(i^{d*}_c\\) (not to be confused with \\(i^{qd*}\\), which are the setpoints obtained in the current control loop).\n\n\nActive and reactive power control\nThe previous section made use of the current setpoints to control the converter. As in the EMT model, they can be determined directly by the user, or they can be obtained from the power setpoints (\\(P^*\\), \\(Q^*\\)), which would still come from the user. To derive the controls, firstly the instantaneous power theory [8] is described briefly for the synchronous frame dq0.\nThe voltage and current phasors can be expressed in the dq0 frame as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv^{qd} &= \\frac{v^q - jv^d}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\ni^{qd} &= \\frac{i^q - ji^d}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe complex power phasor, as well as the active and reactive power values, can now be obtained with:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\underline{S} &= 3 v^{qd}(i^{qd})^* = 3 (\\frac{v^q - jv^d}{\\sqrt{2}})(\\frac{i^q + ji^d}{\\sqrt{2}})\\\\\nP &= \\Re(S) = \\frac{3}{2} (v^q i^q + v^d i^d) \\\\\nQ &= \\Im(S) = \\frac{3}{2} (v^q i^d - v^d i^q)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAs a design choice of the PLL, \\(v_d = 0\\) to track the grid angle. Then, the expressions for current setpoints can be extracted substituting in the previous equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ni^{q*} &= \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{P^*}{v^q} \\\\\ni^{d*} &= \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{Q^*}{v^q}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis relationship can be used to calculate directly the current setpoint for a given value of \\(v^q\\), which could be considered constant if the grid voltage is stable, or it can come directly from the voltage measurements. However, it is not robust when there are transient phenomena or perturbations in the grid voltage. To have a smoother response, a power loop is designed to control the current setpoints using a PI controller. The following block diagram shows the current setpoints output using the power setpoints:\n\n\n\nPower Control Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Power Control Diagram [3]\n\nTo determine the PI controller parameters, we include the current loop as the plant of the power loop, in order to obtain a response that accounts for the inner-loop dynamics. The following block diagram shows the complete power loop:\n\n\n\nPower Control Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Closed-Loop Power Control Diagram\n\nFollowing a similar procedure to the one of the current loop, the closed-loop transfer function of the power loop can be modelled as a first-order system:\n\\[\n\\frac{P(s)}{P^*(s)} = \\frac{Q(s)}{Q^*(s)} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_p s + 1}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\tau_p\\) is the time constant of the power loop. The PI controller can be obtained with the use of the time constant of the current loop as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nK^{ipl}_p &= \\frac{2\\tau_c}{3V_{peak}\\tau_p} \\\\\nK^{ipl}_i &= \\frac{2}{3V_{peak}\\tau_p}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(V_{peak}\\) is used to tune the controller constant since \\(v^q\\) will be close to this value. The time constant \\(\\tau_p\\) will be larger than \\(\\tau_c\\), since the power loop is designed to have a slower response than the current loop.\n\n\nLimitations of current\nThe technical constraints of the VSC can be included in the controls using saturation blocks. Depending on the desired operation mode, the converter can be set to prioritize one of the current components. These operation modes are typically defined by the grid codes, although a possible implementation could be the following:\n\nNormal operation: The converter will follow the \\(i^q\\) component setpoint, prioritizing the active power, and then \\(i^d\\) will be limited by the operational limits of the converter \\(i^d_{max} = \\sqrt{I_{max}^2 - \\max{i^q, i^{q*}}}\\).\nTransient or fault operation: The converter will now prioritize the \\(i^d\\) component, which will follow its reference, and \\(i^q_{max} = \\sqrt{I_{max}^2 - \\max{i^d, i^{d*}}^2}\\).\n\nMore details on how the anti-windup controls are implemented can be found in the EMT Grid Following page.",

    "text": "Derived Models\nThe model presented can have some of its dynamics simplified in order to perform low-frequency domain studies with higher time step (which means, faster execution times). Listed below, ordered from high to low accuracy, some of this models with its assumptions are presented:\n\nPhasor \\(I_1\\): The dynamics of the current loop are approximated by a first-order transfer function with a given time constant \\(\\tau_c\\).\nPhasor \\(I_0\\): The current loop is completely removed (as it has the fastest dynamics of the system), which requires a reformulation of the power loop. The output of the later will be directly considered as the converter current.\nPhasor \\(PQ_1\\): The dynamics of the power loop are approximated by a first-order transfer function with a given time constant \\(\\tau_{pq}\\), similarly to the first case. The current loop is also removed.\n\nThe following figure (which corresponds to Figure 6 of [1]) depicts the performance for all these models compared to the EMT model in one particular scenario, in which the power setpoint tracking for \\(P^*\\), \\(Q^*\\) was studied:\n\n\n\nPhasor Models Comparison\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Phasor Models Error Comparison [1]\n\nAs a summary, the Full-Phasor model is proven as a reliable although slower model. It is capable to solve with good accuracy the system for time step sizes that are outside the convergence range of the EMT model. The \\(I_0\\) and \\(I_1\\) Phasor models are able to reach convergence at bigger time steps with a decent accuracy (around \\(10^3\\) \\(\\mu s\\)), while the \\(PQ_1\\) model is the fastest but with a good accuracy compared to the rest of the models for bigger time steps. Generally, choosing between one or other model depends on the time step size desired to use, rather than the type of study, as all the phasor models can work in a similar range of frequencies, as seen in the following figure:\n\n\n\nPhasor Models Suitability\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Phasor Models Suitability [1]\n\nThe details can be consulted in:\n\nPhasor \\(I_1\\)\nPhasor \\(I_0\\)\nPhasor \\(PQ_1\\)",

In contrast, a grid-forming inverter can actively establish the grid’s voltage and frequency, allowing it to create or stabilize the grid, particularly in situations where traditional grid infrastructure is weak or absent. Unlike grid-following inverters, grid-forming inverters do not rely on a PLL; instead, they can synchronize with the grid similarly to a synchronous generator.

    "text": "Model description\nThe model can be described with the following schematic:\n\n\n\nEMT GF VSC scheme\n\n\n\nFigure 1: EMT Grid Forming VSC scheme [1]\n\nIt is important to note that the currents are measured both at the point of connection of the capacitor filter \\(v_f\\) and at the grid side \\(v_g\\), while the currents are measured before the filter at converter side \\(i_c\\) and after the filter at the grid side \\(i_g\\). Starred notation, such as \\(v_c^{qd*}\\), is used to denote setpoints, in this case the voltage for the equivalent sources of the converter.\nThe existence of modelling this type of filter (an LCL rather than the single L filter used in Grid Following) is due to the usage of a Grid Forming VSC, which can blackstart a network for example. The more complex filter is used to reduce the harmonic distortion of the output voltage and increase the robustness of the control, which is important in this type of application.\n\nClarke and Park transformations\nAssuming a three-phase balanced system, the electrical variables can be expressed in the abc reference frame as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{abc} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_a \\\\ x_b \\\\ x_c \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{2} X \\cos(\\theta) \\\\ \\sqrt{2}X \\cos(\\theta - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) \\\\ \\sqrt{2}X \\cos(\\theta + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(X\\) is the amplitude of the voltage or current, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of the voltage or current. The Clarke transformation [3] is used to convert the three-phase variables into an orthogonal reference frame. The transformation matrix is given by:\n\\[\nT_{\\text{Clarke}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & \\sqrt{3} & -\\sqrt{3} \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwhich applied to the abc variables in balanced conditions, results in the \\(\\alpha\\beta0\\) variables:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{\\alpha\\beta0} = T_{Clarke} x_{abc} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{\\alpha} \\\\ x_{\\beta} \\\\ x_0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{2} X \\cos(\\theta) \\\\ - \\sqrt{2}X \\sin(\\theta)  \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nnoting that \\(x_0 = 0\\) since it is a balanced system. The electrical variables in this new reference are still sinusoidal. It is desirable to have constant valued variables to be able to implement typical PI control over the signal more easily. This is done using the Park transformation [4], converting the \\(\\alpha\\beta\\) variables into a rotating reference frame. The transformation matrix is given by:\n\\[\nT_{\\text{Park}}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\hat{\\theta}) & -\\sin(\\hat{\\theta}) \\\\ \\sin(\\hat{\\theta}) & \\cos(\\hat{\\theta}) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwhich applied to the \\(\\alpha\\beta\\) variables, results in the \\(dq0\\) variables:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{qd0} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{q} \\\\ x_{d} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{2} X \\cos(\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})  \\\\ \\sqrt{2} X \\sin(\\theta - \\hat{\\theta}) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAs it can be seen, the Park transformation is dependent of the angle \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), which is the angle of the rotating reference frame, and it can be different to the angle of the voltage \\(\\theta\\). If the electrical variable is synchronized with the rotating reference frame, then \\(\\theta = \\hat{\\theta}\\) and \\(x_d = 0\\).\n\n\nSynchronization loop\nIn this section, the two main synchronization loop methods for the Grid Forming VSC, the droop control method [5] and the Virtual Synchronous Machine [6] are presented. These controls determine the voltage magnitude and angle that the grid forming will use to operate. There are other alternatives [5], although the most studied are the ones presented in this model. The droop control method is simpler and it has been proven to be a special case of the virtual synchronous machine method [7], while the second one produces slower rates of change of the frequency due to the existence of virtual inertia in stand-alone situations.\nDroop control\nIn the present model, the frequency of the VSC is determined using a synchronization loop that involves an active power droop. Considering a reference grid frequency \\(\\omega^*\\) (normally 50 Hz), the converter frequency will be adjusted around this value considering the active power error, since active power and voltage phases are related in largely inductive grids as in the transmission system. The droop equation is given by:\n\\[\nK_{\\Delta P} = \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{\\Delta P}\n\\]\nwhere the droop constant \\(K_{\\Delta P}\\) is the slope of the droop curve, normally determined by grid codes in terms of the percentual variation of the frequency with respect to a variation of the active power. In addition to this droop control, it is common to apply a low-pass filter to the power measurement: \\(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\Delta P} s + 1}\\), with \\(\\tau_{\\Delta P} = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{\\Delta P}}\\) and \\(\\omega_{\\Delta P}\\) the bandwith of the filter. This avoids having higher harmonics in the frequency signal. The block diagram of the synchronization loop is shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\nSynchronization Loop Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Synchronization Loop Diagram\n\nSimilar to the controls applied over the active power, the reactive power output of the converter is related to the voltage magnitude. In this case, the droop equation is given by:\n\\[\nK_{\\Delta Q} = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta V}\n\\]\nwhere the droop constant \\(K_{\\Delta Q}\\) is the slope of the droop curve. Again, the reactive power measurement is filtered to avoid including high-frequency harmonics, applying a low-pass filter with a bandwidth \\(\\omega_{\\Delta Q}\\), and a time constant \\(\\tau_{\\Delta Q} = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{\\Delta Q}}\\). The block diagram of the reactive power droop control is shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\nReactive Power Droop Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Reactive Power Droop Diagram\n\nVirtual Synchronous Machine (VSM)\nAnother alternative to the droop control is the Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM) control [6], which is a control strategy that emulates the electromechanical behavior of a synchronous machine. This type of control emulates the swing equation of a synchronous machine:\n\\[\nJ \\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = P_r^* - P_e - P_d\n\\]\nwhere \\(J\\) is the inertia of the machine, \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency of the machine, \\(P_r^*\\) is the virtual input power (which emulates the mechanical power), and \\(P_e\\) is the electrical power and \\(P_d\\) is the damping power of the virtual machine. The input power is calculated as the sum of the setpoint power and the droop power deviation \\(P_r^* = P^* + k_{\\omega}(\\omega^*-\\omega)\\), the electrical power is the measure of the active power, and the damping power is obtained from simulating the damping using the relationship \\(P_d = k_d (\\omega - \\omega_g)\\), where \\(\\omega_g\\) is the measure of the grid frequency, that has to be measured using a PLL, which can be the same as in the Grid Following model. The full control diagram is shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\nVSM Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 4: VSM Synchronization Loop Diagram\n\nAs it can be seen, the leftmost part of the control corresponds to the droop control part of the synchronization loop, meaning that the droop control method can be related to a particular case of the VSM method. The reactive power control will be the same as in the droop control method.\nConsidering the qd0 reference frame in which \\(v^{d*} = 0\\), the voltage setpoint \\(v^{q*}\\) is equal to the module obtained from the reactive power droop control. The following section shows the voltage control droops applied to these references.\n\n\nVoltage control\nThe voltage control is used to determine the current setpoints that will be used to control the converter. The tuning of this control has been done using the Internal Model Control method (IMC) [8], which provides PI controllers tuned in terms of the machine parameters (in this case \\(C_f\\)) with the desired response. Using Kirchhoff current law and neglecting the parasite resistance \\(R_{cap}\\) of the capacitors, the differential equations that model the relationship between voltage and currents in the Grid Forming VSC are the following:\n\\[\ni^{qd*}_c - i^{qd}_g = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\\omega C_f \\\\ \\omega{C_f} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} v^{qd}_f + \\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{bmatrix} v^d_f \\\\ v^q_f\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwhere \\(C_f\\) are the capacitance of the filter, \\(i^{qd*}_c\\) are the current setpoints at the converter side, \\(i^{qd}_g\\) are the current measurements at the grid side after the capacitor, and \\(v^{qd}_f\\) are the voltages measured at the filter. A change of variables that considers the coupling can be used to simplify the expressions, as well as using the Laplace transformation:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\hat{i^d} \\\\ \\hat{i^q} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} i^d_c - i^d_g + \\omega C_f v^q_f \\\\ i^q_c - i^q_g - \\omega C_f v^d_f \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} sC_f v^d_f \\\\ sC_f v^q_f\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWith the following block diagram representing the above relationship, and including a PI controller, forming the open-loop block diagram:\n\n\n\nVoltage Control Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Voltage Control Diagram\n\nFrom the previous section, the setpoints are decided to be \\(v^{q*}_f = V\\) and \\(v^{d*}_f = 0\\). To close the loop, the following plant is proposed which relates the decoupling current variables with the voltages:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{v^d_f}{\\hat{i^d}} &= \\frac{1}{sC_f} \\\\\n\\frac{v^q_f}{\\hat{i^q}} &= \\frac{1}{sC_f}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwith the following block diagram:\n\n\n\nVoltage Closed-Loop Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Voltage Closed-Loop Diagram\n\nThe closed-loop transfer function of the voltage control can be obtained by adding a PI controller to the open-loop transfer function. The PI controller is designed to have a second-order response, with the following transfer function:\n\\[\n\\frac{v^{qd}_f}{v^{qd*}} = \\frac{sK^{vcl}_p + K^{vcl}_i}{s^2 C_f +sK^{vcl}_p + K^{vcl}_i}\n\\]\nThe tuning of the control parameters will be so that the denominator adopts the form \\(s^2 + 2\\xi \\omega_n C_f s + \\omega_n^2\\). With this, the values are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nK^{vcl}_p &= 2\\xi \\omega_n C_f \\\\\nK^{vcl}_i &= \\omega_n^2 C_f\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwith a damping factor \\(\\xi\\) often between 0.5 and 1 (\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) is a common value) and a natural frequency \\(\\omega_n\\).\nOver these current setpoints, a current control equivalent to the one from the grid-following can be applied.\n\n\nCurrent control\nThe current control is used to determine the converter voltage that has to be applied in order to maintain the current at the setpoint. The tuning uses again the Internal Model Control method (IMC), described in [8] as in the Grid Following model. The control is based on the electric relationship between the variables:\n\\[\nv_c^{abc*} - v_{f}^{abc} = R_f i_c^{abc} + L_f \\frac{d}{dt} i_c^{abc}\n\\]\nwhich can be transformed into the qd frame to obtain the following equation:\n\\[\nv_c^{qd*} - v_{f}^{qd} =\\begin{bmatrix} R_f & L_f \\omega\\\\ -L_f \\omega & R_f \\end{bmatrix} i_c^{qd} + L_f \\frac{d}{dt} i_c^{qd}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency of the grid obtained in the synchronization loop, and \\(v^{d*} = 0\\). The block diagram associated to this system is the following:\n\n\n\nCurrent Control Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Current Control Diagram\n\nAs it can be seen, there is a coupling between the q and d components. This can be dealt by the controller by designing a two dimension controller, or by decoupling the components and independently controlling each component. The later approach is the chosen in this model, using the following expression:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\hat{v}^{q} \\\\ \\hat{v}^{d} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} v^{q*} - v_f^{q} + L_f \\omega i^d_c  \\\\ v^{d*} - L_f \\omega i^q_c \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{v}^{q}\\) and \\(\\hat{v}^{d}\\) are the controller output voltages. The equations are now decoupled using the expression:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\hat{v}^{q} \\\\ v^{d} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} R_f & 0\\\\ 0 & R_f \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} i^q_c \\\\ i^d_c \\end{bmatrix} + L_f \\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{bmatrix}  i^q_c \\\\ i^d_c \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nApplying the Laplace transformation and reordering, the following relation holds:\n\\[\n\\frac{i^{qd*}_c(s)}{\\hat{v}^{qd}(s)} = \\frac{1}{R_f + sL_f}\n\\]\nThe closed-loop transfer function, considering \\(G_c = K^{icl}_p + \\frac{K^{icl}_i}{s}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{i^{qd}_s(s)}{i^{qd*}_s(s)} = \\frac{G_c(s)}{(L_f + L_c)s + (R_f + R_c) + G_c(s)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(i^{qd*}_c(s)\\) is the reference current for q or d axis at the converter side, and \\(i^{qd}_c(s)\\) is the measured current. The controller gains can be selected as \\(K^{icl}_p = \\frac{L_f}{\\tau_c}\\) and \\(K^{icl}_i = \\frac{R_f}{\\tau_c}\\), where \\(\\tau_c\\) is the time constant of the current loop, such that the complete closed-loop transfer function is represented as the following first-order response:\n\\[\n\\frac{i^{qd}_c(s)}{i^{qd*}_c(s)} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_c s + 1}\n\\]\nThe resulting PI controller is the following:\n\\[\nG_{c}(s) = K_p + \\frac{K_i}{s} = \\frac{L_f}{\\tau_c} + \\frac{R_f}{\\tau_c s}\n\\]\n\n\nLimitations of current\nThe technical constraints of the VSC can be included in the controls using saturation blocks. In section 3.5 of the EMT Grid Following Model, there is an example of implementation of the anti-windup controls for the transformer.\n\n\nModulation\nAs in the EMT Grid Following Model, the converter voltage setpoint obtained can be considered directly the converter voltage, in what is called an Averaged Model, since it does not consider the switching process. However, a more complete EMT simulation will model the modulation performed to obtain the sinusoidal voltage from the DC source. The details can be consulted in Section 3.6 of the said model.",

    "text": "Model description\nThe equivalent circuit of this model is shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Equivalent circuit of the HVDC model\n\nThe bipolar topology is used, distributing the resistance in both the positive and the negative pole cables. Other possible topologies can be considered, such as the monopolar with earth return [1]. Note that the filter is included inside the Grid Forming VSC block.\n\nControl strategy\nThe internal controls of each VSC are the same as the ones described in their individual models. This model presents how each of these converters interact in order to decide which setpoints are provided to each converter, following the criteria explained in [2] [3]. In this model, a point-to-point DC link is considered, although a meshed DC grid could also be modelled following some additional rules covered in [4].\nThe DC electric equations during the transient are given by:\n\n\\[ C \\frac{dV_{DC_1}}{dt} = I_{DC} - I_{DC_1} \\] \\[ C \\frac{dV_{DC_2}}{dt} = I_{DC_2} - I_{DC} \\]\n\nwhere the current \\[I_{DC}\\] corresponds to the DC current flowing through the line, and \\[I_{DC_1}\\] and \\[I_{DC_2}\\] are the currents at the DC side of the converters. The current difference is the current flowing through the capacitor, which will be non-zero during the transient, and zero in the steady-state.\nWhen isolated, a converter can control directly two of the electrical variables, but some are related, such as frequency and active power or reactive power and voltage magnitude. The following table shows the possible control modes for a VSC converter [5]:\n\n\n\nControl Mode\nConstraint 1\nConstraint 2\nVSC Control Type\n\n\n\n\n1\n\\[\\theta\\]\n\\[v_{ac}\\]\nI\n\n\n2\n\\[P_{DC}\\]\n\\[Q_{ac}\\]\nI\n\n\n3\n\\[P_{DC}\\]\n\\[v_{ac}\\]\nI\n\n\n4\n\\[v_{DC}\\]\n\\[Q_{ac}\\]\nII\n\n\n5\n\\[v_{DC}\\]\n\\[v_{ac}\\]\nII\n\n\n6\n\\[v_{DC} \\; droop\\]\n\\[Q_{ac}\\]\nIII\n\n\n7\n\\[v_{DC} \\; droop\\]\n\\[v_{ac}\\]\nIII\n\n\n\nWhen pairing the two converters, there are controls that can overlap and some rules that have to be followed [5]:\n\nThere must be at least a type II or type III VSC type in order to control the DC voltage.\nIf a type II is selected, there can only be one of them while the rest are type I VSCs, otherwise, there would be a conflict between several voltage setpoints.\nThere can be multiple type III VSC as the droop equations can manage the difference in the voltage setpoints.\nWhen stand-alone generation or loads are connected to the VSC, it is mandatory to use a type I converter, as it will serve as the slack bus of the AC side.\n\nIn the model presented, one of the possible configuration (GFM - GFOL) is considered. The GFM is connected to an islanded load/generation, and it will be forming the AC grid of that side as a type I VSC, controlling the angle and the AC voltage magnitude (i.e. it acts as the slack bus of the grid). On the other side, a GFOL is connected to the main grid (an equivalent three-phase voltage source), which is in this case its slack bus, and it controls both \\[V_{DC}\\] and \\[Q_{ac}\\].\n\n\nControl blocks modifications\nBoth converters follow the same control principles as the individual models, but some slight changes are added in order to coordinate both controls.\n\nGrid Forming\nThe main controls of the EMT Grid Forming converter in the DC link are the same as in the isolated mode. In this case, instead of having an AC equivalent voltage source, there is a three-phase load or generator which can be modelled using the ZIP model (for instance, some possibilities would be a fixed impedance load, or a fixed power load/generator). Since there is no grid, the model proposed imposes directly the angle from a reference angular speed, without considering any droop control, as well as the voltage magnitude. This means that the AC side of the GFM converter acts as an ideal voltage source. Another possibility would consider an active power setpoint with a droop control for the frequency. Again, this showcases how the two degrees of freedom of the converter can be used to define the control.\n\n\nGrid Following\nThere are a few more changes in this case since it has to maintain a DC voltage level while exchanging power. Its control resembles the one in the STATCOM model, incorporating a DC voltage control over the standard Grid Following controls, but adding the DC power exchanged in the active power tracking. The modified setpoint tracking is shown in the following block diagram:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Active power control diagram of the HVDC model\n\n\nWhere \\[P_{DC}\\] is the power injected from the DC line, \\[P^*\\] is the power setpoint that has to be drawn from the capacitors from the DC side in order to maintain the voltage and \\[P\\] is the resulting injection to the AC grid grom the GFOL converter.",

The addition of a transformer makes the limits implementation more complex.\nThere is no standardized behavior for the tap changer of the transformer.\nReactive power or AC voltage control is done at the PCC. Introducing a transformer demands to compensate for the reactive losses in the control scheme, leading to a more complex and less readable model, without adding a real added value.\n\n\n\nHVDC physical parts\nThe physical parts of the HVDC line consist in two AC/DC converters and a DC line connecting them.\nConverters\nThe VSC converter is modelled on the AC side by a current injector with a parallel admittance. It transforms the set points of active and reactive currents \\(I_q^*\\) and \\(I_p^*\\) and the internal angle given by the HVDC control into a couple of to be injected in the network currents, which are the real \\(I_r\\) and imaginary \\(I_i\\) values.\n\n\n\nCurrent injection\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Current injection\n\nDC link model\nThe DC link model is incorporated into the controller description and not explicitly physically represented. However, the relationships between DC currents and voltages of the receiving-end and sending-end sides are represented by the following figure:\n\n\n\nElectrotechnical components representing the DC side\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Electrotechnical components representing the DC side\n\nWhere :\n\n\\(C_{DC}\\) represents the equivalent capacity of the converter ( in \\(F\\))\n\\(R_{DC}\\) represents the resistance of the DC cable (in \\(\\Omega\\))\n\n\n\nControl parts\nThe control is divided into two main functions, each one of them associated to one converter:\n\nthe part in charge of the DC voltage control (also called Udc Control) and\nthe part in charge of the active power control (also called P Control).\n\nBoth parts control the reactive power or the voltage at each converter’s terminal (named U/Q Control).\nActive power control\nIt deduces the active current reference \\(I_p^*\\) to give to the converter from an active power reference \\(P^*\\) and a measure of the active power \\(P\\) flowing through the HVDC line thanks to an anti-wind-up proportional integral block.\n\n\n\nP control of the VSC\n\n\n\nFigure 5: P control of the VSC\n\nThe \\(r_{p_{fault}}\\) signal is equal to 1 under normal conditions, and is set to zero when the converter is blocked. It comes back at value 1 following a ramp when the converter is unblocked. This allows to model the ramping power recovery after blocking of the converter.\nThe \\(block\\) signal indicates if the converter is blocked (=1) or not. \\(P_{max}\\) and \\(P_{min}\\) are operating limits (user defined), \\(I_{p_{max}}\\) and \\(I_{p_{min}}\\) are active power limits of the converter.\n\\(\\Delta P\\) is a corrector that allows to adjust the active power of the current converter when the other converter isn’t able to control the DC voltage. It is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\nDelta P calculation\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Delta P calculation\n\nThe Switch signal goes to 1 if the active current \\(I_p^*\\) reaches its caps (by a matter of DUDC, margin added to increase model stability).\nDC Voltage Control\nThe DC voltage control deduces the active current reference \\(I_p^*\\) to give to the converter from a DC voltage reference \\(V_{DC}^*\\) and a measure of the DC voltage \\(V_{DC}\\), thanks to an anti-wind-up proportional integral block.\n\n\n\nVDC control of the VSC\n\n\n\nFigure 7: VDC control of the VSC\n\n\\(I_{P_{MAX}}\\) is the nominal active current of the DC line (in \\(pu\\)).\nNB: if the nominal power \\(S_n\\) is assumed equal to nominal active power \\(P_n\\), there is a correspondance between \\(pu\\) and SI units, \\(I_{p_{max}}\\) will be equal to 1, and InPu will be equal to \\(I_n^{Pu} = \\frac{\\sqrt{P_{max}^2 + Q_{max}^2}}{S_n}\\).\nAC Voltage control\nThis part of the control contains the reactive power/AC voltage control loop (Q-Mode or U-Mode). There is one AC voltage control/reactive power control for each converter, as the AC voltage/reactive power is controlled at each terminal of the HVDC line.\nIn both modes, a reference of the reactive power to be injected to the grid is assessed.\nQ-mode:\n\n\n\nQ mode of the U AC control of the VSC\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Q mode of the U AC control of the VSC\n\nU-mode:\nIn the AC voltage control the control is ensured by the anti-windup proportional integral block, and contains a deadband and a reactive power droop.\n\n\n\nU mode of the U AC control of the VSC\n\n\n\nFigure 9: U mode of the U AC control of the VSC\n\n\\(Q_{max_{comb}}\\) and \\(Q_{min_{comb}}\\) are a combinaison of the operational limits, the PQ limits and the UQ limits as follows:\n\n\n\nCombinaison of the operational, PQ and UQ limits\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Combinaison of the operational, PQ and UQ limits\n\nThe limits \\(Q_{max}^P\\)/\\(Q_{min}^P\\) and \\(Q_{max}^U\\)/\\(Q_{min}^U\\) respectively represent the PQ and UQ diagrams of the link.\nFinally, the reactive power is converted into a reactive reference current \\(I_q^*\\) by the following control:\n\n\n\ncalculation of the reference reactive current by the U AC control of the VSC\n\n\n\nFigure 11: calculation of the reference reactive current by the U AC control of the VSC\n\nWhere:\n\n\\(U\\) represents the voltage value at the PCC.it is limited to a minimum value to avoid divsion by zero.\nThe \\(T_Q\\) time constant represents the dynamics of the voltage/reactive power control.\nThe \\(I_q^{FRT}\\) represents the additional reactive current in case of fault or overvoltage on the AC side. It very much depends on the AC voltage value and gives a fast response to a large disturbance, giving then priority to the reactive current. It is compliant with the HVDC network code [4] and RfG [5] describing the HVDC VSC capability to provide fast fault current (FFC) at a connection point the grid. Reactive current injection during faults helps to both recovering the voltage during faults and to injecting enough current quickly enough for system protections to function reliably.\n\n\n\nCurrent limits\nActive and reactive current limits are calculated in the model depending on the value of \\(I_q^{FRT}\\). By default, the priority is given to the active power control side - i.e no fast reactive current injection (\\(I_q^{FRT}=0\\)) - and the limits are given by the following equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI_{p_{max}} &= I_{P_{MAX}} \\\\\nI_{p_{min}} &= -I_{P_{MAX}} \\\\\nI_{q_{max}} &= \\sqrt{I_n^2 - I_p^{*2}} \\\\\nI_{q_{min}} &= -I_{q_{max}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(I_n\\) (\\(pu\\)) is to total link nominal current.\nif the priority is given to the reactive power control side, then the equations are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI_{q_{max}} &= I_n \\\\\nI_{q_{min}} &= -I_{q_{max}} \\\\\nI_{p_{max}} &= \\sqrt{I_n^2 - I_q^{*2}} \\\\\nI_{p_{min}} &= -I_{p_{max}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nBlocking function\nWhen the voltage goes below at certain threshold \\(U_{block}\\), the converter is blocked for a certain duration \\(T_{block}\\). If the voltage gets back into the range \\([U_{min_{block}}, U_{max_{block}}]\\), it gets unblocked after \\(T_{unblock}\\) seconds.",

    "text": "Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations\nThe model is valid to perform EMT studies of STATCOM devices, specially suited for high-frequency transients and dynamic studies, such as lightning events, switching transients, energization studies, or short-circuits for example. The model is based on the following assumptions:\n\nThe STATCOM is modelled as a Grid Following VSC, although instead of having a DC voltage source, it has a capacitor at the DC side. This means that it can provide small amounts of active power at the exchange of discharging the capacitor, and viceversa.\nThe system is considered to be balanced, and the separation in positive and negative sequence are not considered (i.e. only the positive sequence is considered).\nThe synchronization with the grid is controlled by a PLL, and it is done by imposing that the \\(v_d = 0\\). This design criteria allows to relate active and reactive power with one of the components of the current. It only considers the fundamental frequency.\nThe VSC is assumed to be a 2-level converter, meaning that there are 2 IGBTs per phase.\nThe internal controls are the same as the proposed in the Grid Following model, except instead of having an active power reference, there is a control over the voltage of the capacitor to track a reference.\nAs in the Grid Following model, modulation can be considered or not, depending on the study.\n\nIt is not suited for low-frequency studies (&lt;10 Hz) event though is still accurate, since EMT models are computationally expensive and require a lot of time because greater time steps lead to convergence errors of the simulation. Phasor models exchange some accuracy for much faster simulation times.\nThe model is not valid either for harmonic studies, as it only considers the fundamental frequency.",

This control is explained in the following subsection, while the rest can be consulted in the Grid Following page.\nDC Voltage control\nThe following control is added to the typical Grid Following control scheme in order to maintain the voltage level at the capacitor [2]. This ensures that it is not being overcharged or discharged. For a capacitor with a capacitance value \\(C\\), the following equation relates the power \\(P_{dc}\\) and its energy:\n\\[P_{dc} = V_{DC} I_{DC} = V_{DC} C  \\frac{dV_{DC}}{dt}\\]\nApplying the Laplace transformation, the equation is transformed to the following:\n\\[P_{dc} = V_{DC} C (s V_{DC}) = sCV_{DC}^2\\]\nThe following control structure represents the open-loop of the DC voltage control to obtain an active power reference:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: STATCOM DC Voltage Control open-loop diagram block.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that, in case of an overvoltage, the setpoint obtained will be negative since the capacitor would want to discharge to lower the voltage. Depending on the sign convention used in the AC side, which is typically positive for power injection, a sign change might be necessary. It can be added as a gain as in the figure above (marked in red), but it may not be necessary.\nTo tune the control, the following closed-loop scheme is obtained by considering the relationship between the DC voltage and the DC power derived above as the plant:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: STATCOM DC Voltage Control closed-loop diagram block.\n\n\n\nWhich has the following transfer function:\n\\[\\frac{V_{DC}}{V_{DC}^*} = \\frac{1}{1 + s \\frac{C}{2 G_{DC}(s)}}\\]\nThere are two main control designs:\n\nA proportional control \\(G_{DC(s)} = K_{DC}\\), tuned as \\(K_{pDC} = \\frac{C}{2\\tau_{DC}}\\), with \\(\\tau_{DC}\\) being the desired DC voltage response time constant.\nA PI controller \\(G_{DC(s)} = K_{pDC} + \\frac{K_{iDC}}{s}\\), tuned as \\(K_{pDC} = C\\xi_{DC}\\omega_{DC}\\) and \\(K_{iDC} = \\frac{C\\omega_{DC}^2}{2}\\), with \\(\\xi_{DC}\\) being the desired DC voltage response damping factor and \\(\\omega_{DC}\\) the desired response frequency of the loop.\n\nIn both cases, the DC voltage loop must be slower than the internal current control loop to ensure a stable response.",

The Grid Forming side follows the same progression, although uncontrolled and falling slightly below the rated voltage due to the voltage drop of the link, as expected.\nThe reactive power exchanged with the grid in the Grid Following side is also shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Reactive power exchanged with the grid at the Grid Following side.\n\n\nInitially, no reactive power is exchanged, but after the setpoint change at 0.5 seconds, the reactive power is increased to 0.46 MVAr, as expected.\nLastly, the active power exchanged at both converters can be seen in the following figures:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Active power exchanged with the grid at the Grid Following side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Active power exchanged with the load at the Grid Forming side.\n\n\nWe can see that the active power exchanged in both sides is slightly lower than the expected (1 MW or 1.5 MW). This is due to the characteristics of the load, which is a constant impedance load. The value of this impedance is calculated using the nominal values for voltage and power, and since there is a voltage drop from the converter to the load, the exchanged power is lower than the nominal value.",

The remote converter of each HVDC link is not modelled, the DC voltage being assumed constant. WP1 and WP2 are aggregated equivalents of a large number of generators. The connection transformers of all four VSCs are represented explicitly.\nThe connection to an external system is considered through the Thévenin equivalent attached to bus C. Since the Thévenin voltage source forces the system frequency to return to its nominal value in steady state, this 100% power-electronics based system is clearly not meant to address frequency issues.\nThe 400-kV part of the transmission grid is meshed, allowing to simulate the outage of one or two circuits without disconnection from the external system. The line lenghts are given in Fig. 1. Each wind park is radially connected to the grid through six 225-kV cables and six transformers in parallel to cope with the maximum production of each park. The cables are 50 km long and correspond to the AC connection of an offshore wind farm. The shunt reactors at buses E and F aim at absorbing the excess reactive power produced by the cables.

Nevertheless, the system is N-1 secure with respect to the outage of any 400-kV circuit. No load is present. Hence, the whole production (minus the network losses) is exported to the external system represented by the Thévenin equivalent at bus C, whose short-circuit power has been set to 10 GVA. The operating point is shown in detail in Fig. 2.\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 2: Operating point #1 \n\nIn the second operating point, the wind parks inject the same power, a large fraction of which is evacuated by the HDVC links. This results in a lightly loaded network with larger shunt reactors connected. At this operating point, stability is assessed in terms of minimal short-circuit power of the external system. The corresponding Thévenin reactance is varied. The net power injection of the VSCs (minus the network losses) is taken by the load at bus C, which results in no power flowing into the Th´evenin equivalent. Hence, the initial state remains unchanged while the reactance is varied and there is no risk of reaching the (static) loadability limit of the equivalent (for large values of its reactance). The operating point is shown in detail in Fig. 3.\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 3: Operating point #2",

    "text": "Scenarios and example of simulation results\n\nScenario #1\nScenario # 1 relates to Operating point #1. The event is a solid three-phase fault on one of the two circuits of line A-C, next to bus A. The fault is cleared after 150 ms by opening the line, which remains open. The purpose of the simulation is to test the response to a large disturbance leading to current limitation in the VSCs.\nThe voltage evolutions are given in Fig. 4. During the fault, the voltage at bus A drops to zero, due to the proximity to the fault. The residual voltages at buses B and C are easily explained by their electrical distances from bus A. Voltages quickly recover after fault clearing but they undergo a peak, due to the large injection of reactive power (large value of \\[i_q\\] component of current) during the fault with the aim of supporting voltages. It is of interest to check the value of that peak with EMT simulation.\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 4: Operating point #1: voltages \n\nThe evolution of the VSC active powers is shown in Fig. 5 (left part). During the fault, the active power of HVDC1 drops to zero owing to the zero voltage at bus A. The other three VSCs undergo a severe drop of their active power, owing to the priority given to reactive power. After fault clearing, the active powers regain their pre-disturbance values but with the imposed maximum rate of recovery. The latter is faster for the two HVDC links than for the two wind parks. The right part of the figure shows the corresponding setpoint values of the id components. These setpoints are the input the fact current control loops.\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 5: Operating point #1: : active powers and id current setpoints \n\nThe evolution of the reactive powers is shown in the left part of Fig. 6 while the setpoint values of the iq components are shown in the right part. During the fault, all VSCs have their reactive power increased but their \\[i_q\\] components evolve differently:\n\nWP2, HVDC1 and HVDC2 control their voltages (on the converter side of the connection transformer). The severe voltage drop caused by the fault is counteracted by a quick decrease of \\[i_q\\], which corresponds to maximum injection of reactive power. iq hits the -1 limit, which corresponds to the whole current being taken by the iq component (\\[i_d = 0\\]), in accordance with the reactive power priority;\nWP1 is under reactive power control. During the fault, \\[i_q\\] increases in order to counteract the reactive power increase, before regaining its pre-disturbance value.\n\n\n\n\n\n Fig.6 Scenario #1 : reactive powers and iq current setpoints\n\n\n\nScenario #2\nScenario #2 relies on Operating point #2. The event is the opening of one circuit of the line between buses A and B. This 400-kV circuit carrying only 90 MW, the disturbance can be considered small; the purpose of the simulation is to test the small-disturbance stability of the resulting operating point.\nIn order to find the stability limit of the system, the short-circuit power of the external system (connected to bus C) is progressively decreased, until the response to the disturbance becomes unacceptable, owing to undamped oscillations.\nThe limit value of the short-circuit power obtained with respectively EMT and phasor simulations have been compared. The marginal cases are shown in Fig. 7 for the EMT simulation and Fig. 8 for the phasor-mode simulation. It can be seen that in EMT simulations the system becomes unstable for a short-circuit power around 16 GVA, while in phasor-mode simulations it becomes unacceptable at 5.5 GVA. There is thus a very significant difference. This scenario is very appropriate for future analysis in the BiGER (CRESYM) project.\n\n\n\n\n Fig.7 Scenario #2 : EMT simulations in marginal cases \n\n\n\n\n\n Fig.8 Scenario #2: Phasor-mode simulation in marginal cases",

The line is assumed to only have reactance component, disregarding the resistive part of the impedance. The power received at the end of the line is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nP_R = \\frac{\\|V_S\\|\\|V_R\\|}{X} \\sin(\\delta)\\\\\nQ_R = \\frac{\\|V_R\\|}{X}(\\|V_S\\| - \\|V_R\\|)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(X\\) is the reactance of the line. This received power is consumed by the load at the receiving end. If the active power consumption changes, the torque angle between the two nodes will change accordingly to match the power without varying the voltage level. But if the reactive power consumption changes, the only way to keep the voltage level constant is to inject or absorb reactive power by the means of a shunt element. If the voltage level is too low, a capacitor bank is connected to the end of the line to inject reactive power, increasing the voltage level, while if the voltage level is too high, an reactor bank is connected in order to absorb reactive power, lowering the voltage level. The relationship between voltage level and reactive power can be obtained from the \\(Q_R\\) equation solving the second equation for \\(\\|V_R\\|\\):\n\\[\\|V_R\\| = \\frac{1}{2} \\|V_S\\| + \\frac{1}{2} \\|V_S\\| \\sqrt(1 - \\frac{4 X Q_R}{\\|V_S\\|^2})\\]\nTo maintain the level of voltage, the shunt element has to maintain the same \\(Q_R\\) by absorbing or injecting the reactive power to compensate the load fluctuations: \\(Q_C = Q_R - Q_D\\). If the load is higher than \\(Q_R\\), then the shunt element will need to absorb reactive power, which means it will have to be inductive. If the load is lower than \\(Q_R\\), then the shunt element will need to inject reactive power, which means it will have to be capacitive.\nCompensator dimensioning\nThe compensator is considered to be connected to the end of a transmission line at its voltage level \\(\\|V_R\\|\\). The following schematic represents the simplified circuit:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Compensation scheme\n\n\n\nIn this circuit, the current passing through the compensator is given by:\n\\[I_C = j \\frac{\\|V_R\\|}{\\sqrt(3) X_{C}}\\]\nwhere \\(X_C\\) is the reactance of the compensator device. To calculate the reactive power injected the following equation is used:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\njQ_C = 3 \\frac{\\|V_R\\|}{\\sqrt(3)} (-I_C^*)\\\\\nQ_C = \\frac{\\|V_R\\|^2}{X_{C}}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo dimension the compensator, the reactance is calculated from the desired reactive power injection or absortion and the voltage level that has to be maintained, calculated using the relation derived in the previous section.",

    "text": "Model description\nThe model can be described with the following schematic:\n\n\n\n_Phasor Grid Forming VSC scheme\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Phasor Grid Forming VSC scheme [1]\n\nIt is important to note that the currents are measured both at the point of connection of the capacitor filter \\(v_f\\) and at the grid side \\(v_g\\), while the currents are measured before the filter at converter side \\(i_c\\) and after the filter at the grid side \\(i_g\\). Starred notation, such as \\(v_c^{qd*}\\), is used to denote setpoints, in this case the voltage for the equivalent sources of the converter.\nThe existence of modelling this type of filter (an LCL rather than the single L filter used in Grid Following) is due to the usage of a Grid Forming VSC, which can blackstart a network for example. The more complex filter is used to reduce the harmonic distortion of the output voltage and increase the robustness of the control, which is important in this type of application.\n\nTransformation blocks\nSince we are dealing with phasors that rotate at the grid frequency, instead of instantaneous values, the transformation from the abc reference frame to the qd0 reference frame can be performed by cancelling or applying the rotation of the phasor.\nAssuming we have a complex electrical variable \\(x = Xe^{j\\theta}\\), where \\(X\\) is the amplitude and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of the variable, the transformation to the qd0 reference can be done by multiplying by \\(e^{-j\\theta}\\).\nFor the abc variables, the phasors will be:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{abc} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_a \\\\ x_b \\\\ x_c \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} Xe^{j\\theta} \\\\ Xe^{j(\\theta - \\frac{2\\pi}{3})} \\\\ Xe^{j(\\theta + \\frac{2\\pi}{3})} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(X\\) is the amplitude of the voltage or current, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of the voltage or current. Considering a balanced system, the transformation can be calculated using the deviation of angle of the \\(a\\)-phase measurement with respect to the phase that it would have operating in nominal frequency, which will be referred as \\(\\theta_s\\). The real and imaginary parts of the product of \\(v_a e^{-j\\theta_s}\\) will give the \\(v^q\\) and \\(v^d\\) components of the voltage, respectively.\nIn case of an unbalanced system, the method of symmetrical components would have to be used in order to obtain the positive an negative sequence components.\nInversely, the transformation from qd0 reference frame to abc can be done by performing the following operation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv^a &= (v^q + j v^d)e^{j\\theta_s} \\\\\nv^b &= v^a e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{3}} \\\\\nv^c &= v^a e^{j\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn the case of a Grid Forming VSC, the angle \\(\\theta_s\\) is the angle obtained from the synchronization loop.\n\n\nSynchronization loop\nIn this section, the two main synchronization loop methods for the Grid Forming VSC, the droop control method [4] and the Virtual Synchronous Machine [5] are presented. These controls determine the voltage magnitude and angle that the grid forming will use to operate. There are other alternatives [4], although the most studied are the ones presented in this model. The droop control method is simpler and it has been proven to be a special case of the virtual synchronous machine method [6], while the second one produces slower rates of change of the frequency due to the existence of virtual inertia in stand-alone situations.\nDroop control\nIn the present model, the frequency of the VSC is determined using a synchronization loop that involves an active power droop. Considering a reference grid frequency \\(\\omega^*\\) (normally 50 Hz), the converter frequency will be adjusted around this value considering the active power error, since active power and voltage phases are related in largely inductive grids as in the transmission system. The droop equation is given by:\n\\[\nK_{\\Delta P} = \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{\\Delta P}\n\\]\nwhere the droop constant \\(K_{\\Delta P}\\) is the slope of the droop curve, normally determined by grid codes in terms of the percentual variation of the frequency with respect to a variation of the active power. In addition to this droop control, it is common to apply a low-pass filter to the power measurement: \\(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\Delta P} s + 1}\\), with \\(\\tau_{\\Delta P} = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{\\Delta P}}\\) and \\(\\omega_{\\Delta P}\\) the bandwith of the filter. This avoids having higher harmonics in the frequency signal. The block diagram of the synchronization loop is shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\nSynchronization Loop Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Synchronization Loop Diagram\n\nNotice that, differently to the EMT Grid Forming model, the integration block is applied to the difference of frequency, and not to the whole value. This is due to the phasorial nature of the model, in which the interest lies on the deviation of the angle with respect to the value it would have operating at nominal frequency. Similar to the controls applied over the active power, the reactive power output of the converter is related to the voltage magnitude. In this case, the droop equation is given by:\n\\[\nK_{\\Delta Q} = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta V}\n\\]\nwhere the droop constant \\(K_{\\Delta Q}\\) is the slope of the droop curve. Again, the reactive power measurement is filtered to avoid including high-frequency harmonics, applying a low-pass filter with a bandwidth \\(\\omega_{\\Delta Q}\\), and a time constant \\(\\tau_{\\Delta Q} = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{\\Delta Q}}\\). The block diagram of the reactive power droop control is shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\nReactive Power Droop Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Reactive Power Droop Diagram\n\nVirtual Synchronous Machine (VSM)\nAnother alternative to the droop control is the Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM) control [5], which is a control strategy that emulates the electromechanical behavior of a synchronous machine. This type of control emulates the swing equation of a synchronous machine:\n\\[\nJ \\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = P_r^* - P_e - P_d\n\\]\nwhere \\(J\\) is the inertia of the machine, \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency of the machine, \\(P_r^*\\) is the virtual input power (which emulates the mechanical power), and \\(P_e\\) is the electrical power and \\(P_d\\) is the damping power of the virtual machine. The input power is calculated as the sum of the setpoint power and the droop power deviation \\(P_r^* = P^* + k_{\\omega}(\\omega^*-\\omega)\\), the electrical power is the measure of the active power, and the damping power is obtained from simulating the damping using the relationship \\(P_d = k_d (\\omega - \\omega_g)\\), where \\(\\omega_g\\) is the measure of the grid frequency, that has to be measured using a PLL, which can be the same as in the EMT Grid Following model. The full control diagram is shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\nVSM Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 4: VSM Synchronization Loop Diagram\n\nAs it can be seen, the leftmost part of the control corresponds to the droop control part of the synchronization loop, meaning that the droop control method can be related to a particular case of the VSM method. As before, the integrator block to get the phase is applied to the difference of frequency. The reactive power control will be the same as in the droop control method.\nConsidering the qd0 reference frame in which \\(v^{d*} = 0\\), the voltage setpoint \\(v^{q*}\\) is equal to the module obtained from the reactive power droop control. The following section shows the voltage control droops applied to these references.\n\n\nVoltage control\nThe voltage control is used to determine the current setpoints that will be used to control the converter. The tuning of this control has been done using the Internal Model Control method (IMC) [7], which provides PI controllers tuned in terms of the machine parameters (in this case \\(C_f\\)) with the desired response. Using Kirchhoff current law and neglecting the parasite resistance \\(R_{cap}\\) of the capacitors, the differential equations that model the relationship between voltage and currents in the Grid Forming VSC are the following:\n\\[\ni^{qd*}_c - i^{qd}_g = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\\omega C_f \\\\ \\omega{C_f} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} v^{qd}_f + \\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{bmatrix} v^d_f \\\\ v^q_f\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwhere \\(C_f\\) are the capacitance of the filter, \\(i^{qd*}_c\\) are the current setpoints at the converter side, \\(i^{qd}_g\\) are the current measurements at the grid side after the capacitor, and \\(v^{qd}_f\\) are the voltages measured at the filter. A change of variables that considers the coupling can be used to simplify the expressions, as well as using the Laplace transformation:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\hat{i^d} \\\\ \\hat{i^q} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} i^d_c - i^d_g + \\omega C_f v^q_f \\\\ i^q_c - i^q_g - \\omega C_f v^d_f \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} sC_f v^d_f \\\\ sC_f v^q_f\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWith the following block diagram representing the above relationship, and including a PI controller, forming the open-loop block diagram:\n\n\n\nVoltage Control Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Voltage Control Diagram\n\nFrom the previous section, the setpoints are decided to be \\(v^{q*}_f = V\\) and \\(v^{d*}_f = 0\\). To close the loop, the following plant is proposed which relates the decoupling current variables with the voltages:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{v^d_f}{\\hat{i^d}} &= \\frac{1}{sC_f} \\\\\n\\frac{v^q_f}{\\hat{i^q}} &= \\frac{1}{sC_f}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwith the following block diagram:\n\n\n\nVoltage Closed-Loop Diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Voltage Closed-Loop Diagram\n\nThe closed-loop transfer function of the voltage control can be obtained by adding a PI controller to the open-loop transfer function. The PI controller is designed to have a second-order response, with the following transfer function:\n\\[\n\\frac{v^{qd}_f}{v^{qd*}} = \\frac{sK^{vcl}_p + K^{vcl}_i}{s^2 C_f +sK^{vcl}_p + K^{vcl}_i}\n\\]\nThe tuning of the control parameters will be so that the denominator adopts the form \\(s^2 + 2\\xi \\omega_n C_f s + \\omega_n^2\\). With this, the values are:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nK^{vcl}_p &= 2\\xi \\omega_n C_f \\\\\nK^{vcl}_i &= \\omega_n^2 C_f\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwith a damping factor \\(\\xi\\) often between 0.5 and 1 (\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) is a common value) and a natural frequency \\(\\omega_n\\).\nThe output of this control can be directly be considered to be the current input of the equivalent current sources of the VSC, after transformation in phasor form using the transformation with the obtained angle.\n\n\nLimitations of current\nThe technical constraints of the VSC can be included in the controls using saturation blocks. In section 3.5 of the EMT Grid Following Model, there is an example of implementation of the anti-windup controls for the transformer.",

The model can be used for studying voltage, frequency and angle stability and, to some extent converter-driven stability of the slow interaction type. It is not aimed at being used in EMT studies. As a generic model it renders the overall dynamics observed in real-life systems; it is not aimed at studying a specific behaviour of an existing converter.\nUnlike usual RMS models, the dynamics of the transformer connecting the converter to the grid are represented with their differential (instead of algebraic) equations. On the same time scale the current control loops have been taken into account (instead of being assumed infinitely fast).",

If the simulation step size is desired to be close to the dynamics of the current control loop (around \\(10^3\\) \\(\\mu s\\)), the Phasor-\\(I_1\\) model performs better than the Full-Phasor model, which will have an important increase of the error (or even divergence) when using these step sizes.\nThe assumptions made starting from the Full-Phasor model are the following:\n\nThe current loop is substituted by a first-order transfer function with a given time constant.\n\nThe model shows a performance close to more accurate models during for slow dynamics such as setpoint tracking or voltage/frequency deviation. It can solve high frequency phenomena with clear limitations, as the results do not capture correctly the dynamics of phenomena like asymmetrical faults.\nAlthough it allows a bigger time step than the Full-Phasor model, it eventually will diverge if it is increased too much, as it still retains some dynamics in an approximate way. The Phasor-\\(I_0\\) model is more suitable as it completely removes the current loop dynamics.",

    "text": "Physical description\nThe following schematic shows the components that participate in the synchronous machine operation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Synchronous machine model schematic\n\n\n\n\nPhysical parts of a Synchronous Machine\nA synchronous machine is formed by the following parts:\nRotor\nThe rotor is the moving part of the generator. It is at the end of the rotation axis of the turbine, which is the component that transfers the energy of a moving fluid (normally steam) into mechanical energy. As the name indicates, the mechanical energy corresponds to the rotational kinetic energy of the body composed by the blades and axis of the turbine.\nIt can be round rotor, commonly used in high rotation speed application, or salient pole, used in lower speed applications (i.e. hydro generation) where multiple pair of poles are needed to work at the grid frequency.[2] Both of them will have at least one winding revolving around an axis perpendicular to the rotating axis. The direction of the field produced by the DC excitation will rotate at the same rate as the rotor, pointing in the perpendicular direction of the rotating axis.\nExciter\nThe exciter is the source of power that generates the current flowing through the rotor winding. It applies a DC voltage that generates a current in the rotor winding, creating an electromagnet. It is important for voltage control as increasing the current supplied to the rotor winding increases the induced voltage in the stator winding, providing the ability to apply control loops that ensure the terminal voltage keeps at a setpoint.\nThis electromagnet can be replaced by a permanent magnet, in which case there would be no need to have a DC excitation to create a rotating field. These types of generators (PMSG), which can be found in newer models of wind turbines, have better efficiency as there are no losses associated with the excitation circuit, and lowers the maintenance needed since all the excitation parts are substituted by a single element. As a downside, there is no possibility to control the field by changing the level of excitation. The field magnitude will remain constant value, with a value dependent on the geometry and material of the magnet.\nStator\nIt is the static part of the machine, as its name indicates. This structure gives physical support to the whole machine, while it typically contains the armature winding. It is a three-phase winding distributed in a circular cavity 120º apart one from each other. The uniform rotation of the magnetic field created by the rotor winding will generate currents at each winding 120º apart in the phasorial space. The instantaneous value for each phase is noted as \\(i_a\\), \\(i_b\\), and \\(i_c\\). The following Figure [2] shows the structure of the synchronous machine, including the windings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Stator-rotor of a Synchronous Machine schematic\n\n\n\nGovernor\nThe governor is the controller of the speed of the motor. Its primary function is to maintain the speed of the rotor, and hence the frequency of the electrical output of the generator. It is necessary for adapting to load changes, since a sudden increase or decrease of the load would decelerate or accelerate the generator if no actions are taken. Since it is connected to the prime mover of the generator (generally a turbine), the control will adjust the amount of energy entering the turbine, increasing or decreasing the rate of energy as if it needs to accelerate or decelerate the rotation.\n\n\nSynchronous machine equations\nVariables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\ndetails\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta_{shaft}\\)\nRotor angle\n\\(rad\\)\n\n\n\\(\\omega\\)\nElectrical rotational speed\n\\(rad/s\\)\n\n\n\\(T_m\\)\nMechanical torque\n\\(Nm\\)\n\n\n\\(T_e\\)\nElectrical torque\n\\(Nm\\)\n\n\n\\(T_{fw}\\)\nWindage and friction torque\n\\(Nm\\)\n\n\n\\(v_a\\), \\(v_b\\), \\(v_c\\)\nStator phase voltages\n\\(V\\)\n\n\n\\(i_a\\), \\(i_b\\), \\(i_c\\)\nStator phase currents\n\\(A\\)\n\n\n\\(\\psi_a\\), \\(\\psi_b\\), \\(\\psi_c\\)\nStator phase flux linkages\n\\(Wb\\)\n\n\n\\(\\psi_f\\), \\(\\psi_{1d}\\), \\(\\psi_{1q}\\), \\(\\psi_{2q}\\)\nRotor flux linkages\n\\(Wb\\)\n\n\n\\(v_f\\)\nField voltage\n\\(V\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{ww'}\\)\nTotal inductance between two windings (can be itself)\n\\(H\\)\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(J\\)\nMoment of inertia\n\\(kgm^2\\)\n\n\n\\(p_f\\)\nNumber of pole pairs\n-\n\n\n\\(R_a\\), \\(R_b\\), \\(R_c\\)\nStator phase resistances\n\\(\\Omega\\)\n\n\n\\(R_f\\), \\(R_{1d}\\), \\(R_{1q}\\), \\(R_{2q}\\)\nRotor windings resistances\n\\(\\Omega\\)\n\n\n\\(L_{ww0}\\)\nSelf-inductance of a winding\n\\(H\\)\n\n\n\\(L_{wl}\\)\nLeakage inductance of a winding\n\\(H\\)\n\n\n\\(L_{wg2}\\)\nMutual inductance between windings\n\\(H\\)\n\n\n\\(L_{af}\\)\nMutual inductance between stator and rotor\n\\(H\\)\n\n\n\nSystem of equations\nThe following system of equations describe a general synchronous machine with the considered assumptions.

As it spins, the stator windings will be subjected to a variable magnetic flux caused by the rotation of the produced magnetic field which, according to Faraday’s Law, will induce an electromotive force in the windings.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ne_{emf} = \\frac{d\\psi}{dt}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe rotational speed of the rotor of a synchronous machine is proportional to the grid frequency times the number of poles (i.e. number of different three-phase windings). The induced field in each phase \\(e_{ir}\\) will lead the terminal voltage \\(v_i\\) by a load angle denoted as \\(\\delta\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn = \\frac{120f}{p_f} \\quad (2)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the rotational speed in \\(rev/min\\), \\(f\\) is the stator currents frequency in \\(Hz\\), and \\(p_f\\) is the number of field poles.\nThe coupling between the rotor and the stator windings can be modelled using the terminal voltage equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nv_a = R_a i_a + \\frac{d\\psi_a}{dt}\\\\\nv_b = R_b i_b + \\frac{d\\psi_b}{dt}\\\\\nv_c = R_c i_c + \\frac{d\\psi_c}{dt}\\\\\nv_f = R_f i_f + \\frac{d\\psi_f}{dt}\\\\\nv_{1d} = R_{1d} i_{1d} + \\frac{d\\psi_{1d}}{dt} \\\\\nv_{1q} = R_{1q} i_{1q} + \\frac{d\\psi_{1q}}{dt} \\\\\nv_{2q} = R_{2q} i_{2q} + \\frac{d\\psi_{2q}}{dt} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\psi_i\\) is the magnetic flux passing through the \\(i\\) winding in \\(Wb\\), \\(R_i\\) is the resistance of the associated circuit in \\(\\Omega\\), \\(v_i\\) is the terminal voltage in \\(V\\) and \\(i_i\\) is the current in \\(A\\).\nThe total fluxes are calculated taking into account all the present windings in the synchronous machine, which are the three stator windings and the rotor winding. The fluxes for all the windings are calculated as follows:\nStator fluxes:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\psi_a = \\mathcal{L}_{aa} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{ab} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{ac} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{af} i_f + \\mathcal{L}_{a1d} i_{1d} + \\mathcal{L}_{a1q} i_{1q} + \\mathcal{L}_{a2q} i_{2q}\\\\\n\\psi_b = \\mathcal{L}_{ba} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{bb} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{bc} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{bf} i_f + \\mathcal{L}_{b1d} i_{1d} + \\mathcal{L}_{b1q} i_{1q} + \\mathcal{L}_{b2q} i_{2q}\\\\\n\\psi_c = \\mathcal{L}_{ca} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{cb} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{cc} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{cf} i_f + \\mathcal{L}_{c1d} i_{1d} + \\mathcal{L}_{c1q} i_{1q} + \\mathcal{L}_{c2q} i_{2q}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nRotor fluxes:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\psi_f = \\mathcal{L}_{fa} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{fb} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{fc} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{ff} i_f + \\mathcal{L}_{f1d} i_{1d}\\\\\n\\psi_{1d} = \\mathcal{L}_{1da} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{1db} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{1dc} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{1df} i_f + \\mathcal{L}_{1dqd} i_{1d}\\\\\n\\psi_{1q} = \\mathcal{L}_{1qa} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{1qb} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{1qc} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{1q1q} i_{1q} + \\mathcal{L}_{1q2q} i_{2q}\\\\\n\\psi_{2q} = \\mathcal{L}_{2qa} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{2qb} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{2qc} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{2q1q} i_{1q} + \\mathcal{L}_{2q2q} i_{2q}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwith \\(\\mathcal{L}_{pp}\\) being the self inductance of the winding and \\(\\mathcal{L}_{pp'}\\) the mutual inductance between winding \\(p\\) and winding \\(p'\\), both in \\(H\\). As it can be seen, the q axis damper windings and the d axis damper and rotor windings do not interact since they are perpendicular.\nThe inductance values expressed using the notation \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) express a general dependency with respect to the rotor position \\(\\theta_{shaft} = \\omega t + \\theta_0\\) [4]. It is modelled as a sinusoidal dependency with respect to the electrical angle \\(\\theta_{me}\\). This angle can be calculated as a function of the rotor position angle expression seen before as \\(\\theta_{me} = \\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft} = \\omega_{me} t + \\theta_{e0}\\).\nThe general expression for mutual inductance would be \\[\\mathcal{L}_{pp} = L_{pp} = L_{pp0} + L_{pl} + L_{g2}\\cos(2\\theta_{me})\\] where the first term corresponds to the portion of the inductance due to the air gap, and the second term corresponds to the leakage flux. The mutual inductances, considering a perfect 120º separation between windings, and having \\(\\cos(120º) = -1/2\\) take the values \\(\\mathcal{L}_{pp'} = -\\frac{1}{2} L_{pp0} + L_{g2}\\cos(2\\theta_{me})\\).\nConsidering that all the windings are assumed to have the same characteristics, the inductances for the different phases will only differ in the angular term of the rotor position, which will have additional phase terms of \\((0º, 120º, -120º)\\) for phases \\((a, b, c)\\) respectively.\nThe stator-rotor inductance also depends on the electrical angle \\(\\theta_{me}\\) between the rotor winding axis and the stator winding axis. The value of this inductance for phase \\(a\\) can be calculated with the expression \\[\\mathcal{L}_{af} = \\mathcal{L}_{fa} = L_{af}\\cos(\\theta_{me})\\], while the same expression can be applied for phase \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) but replacing \\(\\theta_{me}\\) with \\(\\theta_{me} - 120º\\) and \\(\\theta_{me} + 120º\\) respectively.\n\n\nOperational limits\nDepending on the difference in phase between the rotor and grid rotation, the power transferred will be composed of active (\\(P\\)) and reactive (\\(Q\\)) power.\nThese generated powers are limited by the heat limits of the components of the generator. The limits considered are the Armature and field current limit, due to Joule effect heating of both windings, and end region heating limit, which occurs due to currents in the structure of the stator when the field is underexcited.\nThe following charts show the capability and compound curves for different power factors[1].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Capability curve of a Synchronous Generator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Compound curves of a Synchronous Generator\n\n\n\n\nThe left chart shows the \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) maximum values for different limit curves, which depend on the refrigerator used, while the right chart shows the dependency on exciter current and apparent power for different values of the power factor.",

    "text": "Operational principles\nThe modeling approach is similar to the one used in GENTPJ, with the following changes.\n\nChanges in the saturation calculation\nAs in the GENTPJ model, the three following functions are the most commonly used to calculate the saturation:\n\nQuadratic: \\[ Sat(x) = B(x-A)^2\\]. Used in GE PSLF and PowerWorld Simulator.\nScaled Quadratic: \\[ Sat(x) = \\frac{B(x-A)^2}{x}\\]. Used in PTI PSS/E and PowerWorld Simulator.\nExponential: \\[ Sat(x) = Bx^A\\]. Used in BPA-IPF nad some specific models of PTI PSS/E and PowerWorld Simualtor.\n\nIn this case, the variable will be the magnetic flux \\[ S_a = Sat(\\Psi_{ag})\\] which is calculated using the air gap voltage as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Psi_{ag} = \\frac{1}{1+\\omega} \\sqrt(V_{qag}^2 + V_{dag}^2) \\\\\nV_{qag} + V_q + I_qR_a + I_dX_l\\\\\nV_{dag} + V_d + I_dR_a - I_dX_l\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nand then, the saturation of each axis is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nSat_d = Sat_q = 1 + S_a \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nScaling of the fluxes and reactances\nIn the GENTPJ, only the subtransient reactances were affected by the saturation effects. In this GENQEC model, the saturation effects are extended to all the reactances and fluxes:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nX''_{dsat} = \\frac{X''_d - X_l}{Sat_d} + X_l \\\\\nX''_{qsat} = \\frac{X''_q - X_l}{Sat_q} + X_l \\\\\nX'_{dsat} = \\frac{X'_d - X_l}{Sat_d} + X_l \\\\\nX'_{qsat} = \\frac{X'_q - X_l}{Sat_q} + X_l \\\\\nX_{dsat} = \\frac{X_d - X_l}{Sat_d} + X_l \\\\\nX_{qsat} = \\frac{X_q - X_l}{Sat_q} + X_l \\\\\nT'_{d0sat} = \\frac{T'_{d0}}{Sat_d} \\\\\nT'_{q0sat} = \\frac{T'_{q0}}{Sat_q} \\\\\nT''_{d0sat} = \\frac{T''_{d0}}{Sat_d} \\\\\nT''_{q0sat} = \\frac{T''_{q0}}{Sat_q} \\\\\nE_{fdsat} = \\frac{E_{fd}}{Sat_d} \\\\\nX_{mdsat} I_{fd} = \\left( X_{dsat} - X_l \\right) I_{fd} = \\frac{X_d - X_l}{Sat_d} I_{fd} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe following figure shows the block diagram for this GENQEC model [2]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Block diagram of the GENQEC model",

DC type 2 excitation system model with added speed multiplier, added lead-lag, and voltage-dependent limits. D2CA model represents represent field-controlled dc commutator exciters with continuously acting voltage regulators having supplies obtained from the generator or auxiliary bus. It differs from the Type DC1A model only in the voltage regulator output limits, which are now proportional to terminal voltage \\(V_T\\). It is representative of solid-state replacements for various forms of older mechanical and rotating amplifier regulating equipment connected to dc commutator exciters.\nThis voltage regulator model appears under the name ExcDC2A in (Electrical and Engineers 2016), the Common Information Model for Dynamics - Standard Models (2012) (Commission 2012), and in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version (Commission 2024).",

    "text": "This model consist of an ac alternator with either stationary or rotating rectifiers to produce the dc field requirements.Upgrades to earlier ac excitation systems, which replace only the controls but retain the ac alternator and diode rectifier bridge, have resulted in this new model.\nThis voltage regulator model first appeared in the IEEE Std 421.5-2016 (Electrical and Engineers 2016). It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version (Commission 2024). In the previous standard version (2005), its predecessor model was called AC7B. Compared to AC7B, AC7C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs, and additional flexibility for the representation of the controlled rectifier power source.\n\n\n\nIt takes into account loading effects. It can’t allow the supply of negative field current. It takes into account saturation.\nThis model is satisfactory for large scale simulations. However, if this model is used to design phase lead networks for power system stabilizers, and the local mode is close to 3 Hz or higher, a more detailed treatment of the ac rotating exciter may be needed.\nExcitation systems incorporating rotating machines produce a field voltage output (\\(E_{FD}\\)) which is proportional to the rotating speed of the machine. Since this effect is negligible when speed deviations are small which is the case of dynamic studies of large interconnected power systems, the effect of speed deviations on the output of the dc rotating exciter models is not represented in this latest version of the standard. However, some commercial software may have implemented such speed dependency in their model.\n\n\n\nThe input variables are :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\nUnits\n\n\n\n\n\\(I_r\\)\nrotor

    "text": "This model consist of an ac alternator with either stationary or rotating rectifiers to produce the dc field requirements.Upgrades to earlier ac excitation systems, which replace only the controls but retain the ac alternator and diode rectifier bridge, have resulted in this new model.\nThis voltage regulator model first appeared in the IEEE Std 421.5-2016 (Electrical and Engineers 2016). It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version (Commission 2024). In the previous standard version (2005), its predecessor model was called AC7B. Compared to AC7B, AC7C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs, and additional flexibility for the representation of the controlled rectifier power source.",

    "text": "It takes into account loading effects. It can’t allow the supply of negative field current. It takes into account saturation.\nThis model is satisfactory for large scale simulations. However, if this model is used to design phase lead networks for power system stabilizers, and the local mode is close to 3 Hz or higher, a more detailed treatment of the ac rotating exciter may be needed.\nExcitation systems incorporating rotating machines produce a field voltage output (\\(E_{FD}\\)) which is proportional to the rotating speed of the machine. Since this effect is negligible when speed deviations are small which is the case of dynamic studies of large interconnected power systems, the effect of speed deviations on the output of the dc rotating exciter models is not represented in this latest version of the standard. However, some commercial software may have implemented such speed dependency in their model.",

    "text": "Model description\n\nModel schema\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Model schema, based on [3]\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor control paths\nThe following section is based on [1] (p. 517f).\nThe model has three major control paths (speed/load, acceleration, temperature) associated with the dynamic response during disturbances. Outputs of these control functions are all inputs into a minimum value selector determining the least fuel request. This is then given to the actuator.\n\nSpeed/load (fsrn)\nThis can be considered the main control path. It corresponds directly to the governor. The inputs are load demand \\(P_{ref}\\), rotor speed \\(\\omega\\) and automatic generation control power \\(P_{MWSet}\\).\nThe resulting signal is then passed through a deadband, limits and a PID-controller. To represent a specific governor, some elements can be deactivated by setting parameters to zero (examples in [1]).\nSupervisory load controller\nIn [3] the \\(P_{MWSet}\\) path is described as an optional additional outer loop associated with a power plant control (supervisory load controller). This is active when \\(K_{I,MW}\\) is not equal to zero. It is a slow acting reset control and it adjusts the speed/load reference of the turbine governor to maintain the electrical power of the unit at the value which it has been initialized with. That value is stored in \\(P_{MW,set}\\) when the model is initialized, and can be changed during simulation. The load controller is expected to have a slow reaction compared to the speed governor. [3]\nA value \\(K_{I,MW}\\) = to 0.01 corresponds to a time constant of 100 s; 0.001 corresponds to 1000 s (relatively slow acting) [3].\nAcceleration (fsra)\n\n[…] for studies of large power systems, [the acceleration control loop] can be ignored. It is important for islanding studies and smaller power systems with large frequency variations. If the generating unit begins to accelerate at a rate over [\\(a_{set}\\)] (\\(pu/s^2\\)) then this control loop acts to limit fuel flow. [1]\n\nIt can be disabled by setting \\(a_{set}\\) to a large value, such as 1. [3]\nTemperature (fsrt) / load limit\nThe load limiter module allows to set a maximum output limit \\(P_{ldref}\\). This can also model an exhaust temperature limit, in which case \\(P_{ldref}\\) is not to be interpreted as a power value. The time constant \\(T_{f,load}\\) should match the measurement time constant for temperature (or power or which ever signal is being modelled). Additionally, the gains of the limiter, \\(K_{P,load}\\) and \\(K_{I,load}\\), should be set to achieve fast and stable control when the limit \\(P_{ldref}\\) is reached. To deactivate the load limit, set the parameter \\(P_{ldref}\\) to a high value [3].\nThe lead-lag block with \\(T_{sa}\\) and \\(T_{sb}\\) can be used to model the exhaust gas temperature measurement system in gas turbines. A “radiation shield” component of larger gas turbines can be modeled by setting \\(T_{sa}=4\\,s\\) and \\(T_{sb}=5\\,s\\), for example [3].\n\nThe temperature limit [tlim] in \\(pu\\) corresponds to the fuel flow required for 1 \\(pu\\) turbine power. [1]\n\n\n\nTurbine/engine model\nThe output from the low value select block is given to the first order lag element representing the fuel or gate system (Valve). [1]\n\\(V_{max}\\) and \\(V_{min}\\) represent the maximum and minimum fuel valve opening. \\(W_{fspd}\\) is the fuel flow multiplyer.\n\\(W_{fnl}\\) is the fuel required to run the compensator [1].\nThe range of fuel valve travel and of fuel flow is unity, so the limits lie between 0 \\(pu\\) and 1 \\(pu\\). \\(V_{max}\\) can be reduced below 1, for example to model a load limit defined by the operator or supervisory controller [3]. Additionally there is a dynamic frequency dependent limit reduction, see Frequency dependent (valve) limit section.\nFor a gas turbine, in the presence of a minimum firing limit, \\(V_{min}\\) normally is set greater than zero and less than \\(W_{fnl}\\) [3].\nThe value of the fuel flow at maximum power shall be \\(\\leq 1\\), depending on the value of \\(K_{turb}\\) [3]. It translates the fuel consumption (or water flow) to mechanical power output [1].\nThe time delay \\(e^{-sT_{eng}}\\) is used in representing diesel engines where there is a small but measurable transport delay between a change in fuel flow setting and the development of torque. \\(T_{eng}\\) should be zero in all but special cases where this transport delay is of particular concern [3].\nThe switch \\(W_{fspd}\\) is responsible for recognizing whether fuel flow, for a given fuel valve stroke, is be proportional to engine speed [3]. If True, fuel flow is proportional to speed. This is applicable for some gas turbines and diesel engines with positive displacement fuel injectors. If false, the fuel control system keeps fuel flow independent of engine speed.\nSpeed sensitivity / Damping\nIf \\(D_m=0\\), the speed sensitivity paths are not active. [3]\nIf \\(D_m&gt;0\\), it models friction losses (variation of the engine power with the shaft speed; slightly increasing losses with increasing speed are characteristic for reciprocating engines and some aeroderivative turbines [3]).\nIf \\(D_m&lt;0\\), it can model an influence of rotation speed on exhaust temperature using an exponential characteristic determined by \\(D_m\\). The maximum permissible fuel flow falls with falling speed (typical for single-shaft industrial turbines due to exhaust temperature limits) [3]. The authors suspect that this could represent fan cooling.\n\n\nFrequency dependent (valve) limit\nThe frequency-dependent limit block outputs the upper limit for valve position / the fuel flow signal fsr. It is shown in Figure 2.\nIn normal operation, the limit is \\(V_{max,\\omega} = V_{max}\\) and the there is no frequency dependent reduction.\nWhen the frequency \\(f\\) in Hz drops below \\(f_{lim,1}\\), the value for \\(P_{lim}\\), the power limit, is calculated by linear interpolation between the values \\(f_{lim,1}, f_{lim,2}, \\dots\\) and \\(P_{lim,1}, P_{lim,2}, \\dots\\) of a lookup table. The table consists of 10 data points which monotonically decrease in both power and frequency, point 1 being the hightest. The lowest data point does act as a lower limit, i.e. is not extrapolated to lower values.\n\\(V_{max,\\omega}\\) then ramps with the rate \\(P_{rate}\\) from the initial and maximum value to the new value \\(V_{max,\\omega} = (P_{lim} / K_{turb} + W_{fnl})\\).\n\\(P_{lim}\\) will then change with frequency.

This type of model is often used in large-scale stability studies, for which it reflects the relevant phenomena. It is not a detailed physical model of the unit. Also for some stability phenomena (e.g. resonance stability) this model is not sufficient and EMT models or other approaches may be necessary.\nThe gates operate within a range of 0 to 1 \\(pu\\), transitioning from fully closed to fully open. At zero power, the gates maintain a position greater than zero, and typically remain below 1 \\(pu\\) when power is at 1 \\(pu\\). The operating limits are defined by \\(G_{max}\\) and \\(G_{min}\\).\nThe dynamic analysis of hydraulic turbines is typically based on the following assumptions regarding the stability of the water column [1]:\n\nHydraulic resistance is considered negligible.\nThe penstock pipe is assumed to be inelastic, and the water is treated as incompressible.\nWater velocity is directly proportional to the gate opening and to the square root of the net head.\nTurbine output power is directly proportional to the product of the head and the volumetric flow rate.",

This curve is proportional to turbine power, with the constant of proportionality determined by the turbine gain.\nFrancis/Pelton: The non-linear gate opening-to-turbine power characteristic is described by points in the green curve\n\n\n\nKaplan: This model uses points through the blue curve from the 1 to define the non-linear characteristics of gate opening-to-turbine power and gate opening-to-blade angle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The gate-head-flow-power characteristics for a kaplan turbine model [3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Gate head flow characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(G_v\\)\n\\(P_{gv}\\) (Francis)\n\\(P_{gv}\\) (Kaplan)\n\\(P_{gv}\\) (Simple)\n\n\n\n\n\\(0\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\\(0.1\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(0.1\\)\n\n\n\\(0.4\\)\n\\(0.42\\)\n\\(0.35\\)\n\\(0.4\\)\n\n\n\\(0.5\\)\n\\(0.56\\)\n\\(0.468\\)\n\\(0.5\\)\n\n\n\\(0.7\\)\n\\(0.8\\)\n\\(0.796\\)\n\\(0.7\\)\n\n\n\\(0.8\\)\n\\(0.9\\)\n\\(0.917\\)\n\\(0.8\\)\n\n\n\\(0.9\\)\n\\(0.97\\)\n\\(0.99\\)\n\\(0.9\\)\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The output signal of the lookup-table actually represents a flow rate, not a power value (\\(q_f\\) in Figure 2). Since in [3] the power variable \\(P_{gv}\\) is used instead, this is also used here in 1 and Table 3\n\n\nTransient droop\nHydro power turbines have a unique behavior, where adjusting the gate position for controlling water flow results in an immediate but temporary change in turbine power output to the opposite direction, known as non-minimum phase behavior. To address this, a mechanism called transient droop compensation is employed. This mechanism, which shown in the upper half of the Figure 2, involves rate feedback or transient gain reduction, which slows down or limits gate movement until water flow and power output have had time to adjust. As the system stabilizes, the governor returns to normal operation with permanent droop \\(R_{perm}\\), responding more sensitively to speed deviations to maintain steady-state operation. This compensation mechanism ensures stable control performance, crucial for maintaining the stability of hydroelectric power plants [1].\n\n\nDead bands\nThere is a difference between the intentional deadband (\\(\\Delta \\omega_{db}\\), \\(\\Delta \\omega_{\\varepsilon}\\)) and the unintentional deadband (\\(\\Delta P_{db}\\)). The former is intentionally added to the control to prevent continuous adjustment of the mechanical power in response to minor frequency deviations. It has a fixed region with zero output. The latter implements a hysteresis around the operating point, representing backlash of the mechanical actuator [5].",
