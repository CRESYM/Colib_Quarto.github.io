It is the most common type of generators, and it is present in most power plants (thermal, hydro, and some wind) as an interface between the mechanical energy and electrical energy. The mathematical model presented in this article develops the dynamic equations of synchronous machines Doe (2100) It only covers the physical part of the machine (see Section 3) not the regulations nor protections schemes.",

For each component, is given: a brief explanation about the functioning of the component (how it works, what it is made of, which implementation choices are made) and the component equations or control diagram. The author can also point to another component page if the component is already explained in another page. In such case, he clearly needs to make coherence is achieved with the rest of the model in terms of notation, convention, and connection aspects.\n\nFor the equation system / algorithm : the author can use Latex language, which is fully compatible with markdown. He can also use numbered equations. The variables and parameters should be clearly specified, as well as their type (complex, real, etc.), unit (MW, MVA, etc), and meaning (phase to neutral voltage for the output terminal A). The notation should follow scientific standards.\nImages or Electric/Electronic/Control/Phasor diagramscan be added for clarity. The image must be of good quality and more preferably in .svg format. Diagrams can be used instead of equations to describe the component. The selected control blocks should be unambiguous, that is to say that their equations should be clearly understood from the diagram. A list of basic blocks can be found in colib here: pages/models/controlBlocks/. Several packages can be used to display diagrams, e.g.: draw.io plugin for github allows you to make your own diagram easily. The diagram is fully editable with github commit using a graphical interface, and allowing multiple format outputs (for more details, see: draw.io github). \nInitial equations/boundary conditions: when initial equations or boundary conditions are necessary to fully described the system, a subsection dedicated to those aspects can be added in this section.\n\nExample:\n\nPhysical description\nThe following schematic shows the components that participate in the synchronous machine operation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Synchronous machine\n\n\n\n[…]\n\n\nSynchronous machine equations\n\nVariables\n\n\n\nVariable\ndetails\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta_{shaft}\\)\nRotor angle\n\\(rad\\)\n\n\n\\(\\omega\\)\nElectrical rotational speed\n\\(rad/s\\)\n\n\n\\(T_m\\)\nMechanical torque\n\\(Nm\\)\n\n\n\\(T_e\\)\nElectrical torque\n\\(Nm\\)\n\n\n\n[…]\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(J\\)\nMoment of inertia\n\\(kgm^2\\)\n\n\n\\(p_f\\)\nNumber of pole pairs\n-\n\n\n\\(R_a\\), \\(R_b\\), \\(R_c\\)\nStator phase resistances\n\\(\\Omega\\)\n\n\n\n[…]\n\n\nSystem of equations\nThe following system of equations describe a general synchronous machine with the considered assumptions. Some of its parameters are generally non-constant, meaning it is not directly solved without making some additional assumptions. The particular models are derivations of this system of equations.\nThe equations Equation 1, Equation 2 represent the mechanical dynamic equations: \\[\nJ\\frac{2}{p_f}  \\frac{d\\omega_m}{dt} = T_m - T_e - T_{fw}\n\\tag{1}\\] \\[\\frac{d\\theta_{shaft}}{dt} = \\frac{2}{p_f} \\omega \\tag{2}\\]\n[…]",

    "text": "Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations\nGovHydro4 is a general model that can be used to represent simple, Francis/Pelton or Kaplan turbines [3].\nThe model is a positive-sequence RMS model, hence it assumes symmetrical operating conditions and neglects high-frequency dynamics. This type of model is often used in large-scale stability studies, for which it reflects the relevant phenomena. It is not a detailed physical model of the unit. Also for some stability phenomena (e.g. resonance stability) this model is not sufficient and EMT models or other approaches may be necessary.\nThe gates operate within a range of 0 to 1 PU, transitioning from fully closed to fully open. At zero power, the gates maintain a position greater than zero, and typically remain below 1 PU when power is at 1 PU. The operating limits are defined by Gmax and Gmin.\nThe dynamic analysis of hydraulic turbines is typically based on the following assumptions regarding the stability of the water column [1]:\n\nHydraulic resistance is considered negligible.\nThe penstock pipe is assumed to be inelastic, and the water is treated as incompressible.\nWater velocity is directly proportional to the gate opening and to the square root of the net head.\nTurbine output power is directly proportional to the product of the head and the volumetric flow rate.",

Since in [3] the power variable \\[P_\\mathrm{gv}\\] is used instead, this is also used here in Figure 1 and Table 3\n\n\n\nTransient droop\nHydro power turbines have a unique behavior, where adjusting the gate position for controlling water flow results in an immediate but temporary change in turbine power output to the opposite direction, known as non-minimum phase behavior. To address this, a mechanism called transient droop compensation is employed. This mechanism, which shown in the upper half of the Figure 2, involves rate feedback or transient gain reduction, which slows down or limits gate movement until water flow and power output have had time to adjust. As the system stabilizes, the governor returns to normal operation with permanent droop \\[R_\\mathrm{perm}\\], responding more sensitively to speed deviations to maintain steady-state operation. This compensation mechanism ensures stable control performance, crucial for maintaining the stability of hydroelectric power plants [1].\n\n\nDead bands\nThere is a difference between the intentional deadband (\\[\\Delta \\omega_\\mathrm{db}\\], \\[\\Delta \\omega_\\mathrm{\\varepsilon}\\]) and the unintentional deadband (\\[\\Delta P_\\mathrm{db}\\]). The former is intentionally added to the control to prevent continuous adjustment of the mechanical power in response to minor frequency deviations. It has a fixed region with zero output. The latter implements a hysteresis around the operating point, representing backlash of the mechanical actuator [5].",

    "text": "In a power plant, a governor regulates the mechanical power (\\[P_m\\]) or torque (\\[T_m\\]) delivered from the turbine to the electrical generator. This governor model includes the turbine dynamics, i.e. it takes a reference power and generator speed and outputs the mechanical torque.\nThis GovCT2 is a modification of the GovCT1 in order to represent the frequency-dependent fuel flow limit of a specific gas turbine manufacturer. Both are based on Rowen’s model from 1983 [1].\nWhen comparing to older standards: GovCT2 is identical to GGOV2 and GovCT1 is identical to GGOV1.\nGovCT2 is part of the CIM/CGMES standard, see [2] and [3]. CIM is developed by ENTSO-E and aims at ensuring the reliability of grid models and market information exchanges. ENTSO-E developed CGMES as a superset of the IEC CIM standards (belonging to IEC CIM16) in 2013 to fulfill the requirements of transmission system operators and their data exchanges.\nThe following information has been gathered from [2], [4] and [3].",

    "text": "Model description\n\nModel schema\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Model schema, based on [3]\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor control paths\nThe following section is based on [1] (p. 517f).\nThe model has three major control paths (speed/load, acceleration, temperature) associated with the dynamic response during disturbances. Outputs of these control functions are all inputs into a minimum value selector determining the least fuel request. This is then given to the actuator.\n\nSpeed/load (fsrn)\nThis can be considered the main control path. It corresponds directly to the governor. The inputs are load demand \\[P_\\mathrm{ref}\\], rotor speed \\[\\omega\\] and automatic generation control power \\[P_\\mathrm{MWSet}\\].\nThe resulting signal is then passed through a deadband, limits and a PID-controller. To represent a specific governor, some elements can be deactivated by setting parameters to zero (examples in [1]).\n\nSupervisory load controller\nIn [3] the \\[P_\\mathrm{MWSet}\\] path is described as an optional additional outer loop associated with a power plant control (supervisory load controller). This is active when \\[K_\\mathrm{I\\,MW}\\] is not equal to zero. It is a slow acting reset control and it adjusts the speed/load reference of the turbine governor to maintain the electrical power of the unit at the value which it has been initialized with. That value is stored in \\[P_\\mathrm{MW\\,set}\\] when the model is initialized, and can be changed during simulation. The load controller is expected to have a slow reaction compared to the speed governor. [3]\nA value \\[K_\\mathrm{I\\,MW}\\] = to 0.01 corresponds to a time constant of 100 s; 0.001 corresponds to 1000 s (relatively slow acting) [3].\n\n\nAcceleration (fsra)\n\n[…] for studies of large power systems, [the acceleration control loop] can be ignored. It is important for islanding studies and smaller power systems with large frequency variations. If the generating unit begins to accelerate at a rate over [\\[a_\\mathrm{set}\\]] (pu/s^2) then this control loop acts to limit fuel flow. [1]\n\nIt can be disabled by setting \\[a_\\mathrm{set}\\] to a large value, such as 1. [3]\n\n\nTemperature (fsrt) / load limit\nThe load limiter module allows to set a maximum output limit \\[P_\\mathrm{ldref}\\]. This can also model an exhaust temperature limit, in which case \\[P_\\mathrm{ldref}\\] is not to be interpreted as a power value. The time constant \\[T_\\mathrm{f\\,load}\\] should match the measurement time constant for temperature (or power or which ever signal is being modelled). Additionally, the gains of the limiter, \\[K_\\mathrm{P\\,load}\\] and \\[K_\\mathrm{I\\,load}\\], should be set to achieve fast and stable control when the limit \\[P_\\mathrm{ldref}\\] is reached. To deactivate the load limit, set the parameter \\[P_\\mathrm{ldref}\\] to a high value [3].\nThe lead-lag block with \\[T_\\mathrm{sa}\\] and \\[T_\\mathrm{sb}\\] can be used to model the exhaust gas temperature measurement system in gas turbines. A “radiation shield” component of larger gas turbines can be modeled by setting \\[T_\\mathrm{sa}=4\\,\\mathrm{s}\\] and \\[T_\\mathrm{sb}=5\\,\\mathrm{s}\\], for example [3].\n\nThe temperature limit [tlim] in pu corresponds to the fuel flow required for 1 pu turbine power. [1]\n\n\n\n\nTurbine/engine model\nThe output from the low value select block is given to the first order lag element representing the fuel or gate system (Valve). [1]\n\\[V_\\mathrm{max}\\] and \\[V_\\mathrm{min}\\] represent the maximum and minimum fuel valve opening. \\[W_\\mathrm{fspd}\\] is the fuel flow multiplyer.\n\\[W_\\mathrm{fnl}\\] is the fuel required to run the compensator [1].\nThe range of fuel valve travel and of fuel flow is unity, so the limits lie between 0 pu and 1 pu. \\[V_\\mathrm{max}\\] can be reduced below 1, for example to model a load limit defined by the operator or supervisory controller [3]. Additionally there is a dynamic frequency dependent limit reduction, see Section 3.2.3.\nFor a gas turbine, in the presence of a minimum firing limit, \\[V_\\mathrm{min}\\] normally is set greater than zero and less than \\[W_\\mathrm{fnl}\\] [3].\nThe value of the fuel flow at maximum power shall be \\[\\leq 1\\], depending on the value of \\[K_\\mathrm{turb}\\] [3]. It translates the fuel consumption (or water flow) to mechanical power output [1].\nThe time delay \\[e^{-sT_\\mathrm{eng}}\\] is used in representing diesel engines where there is a small but measurable transport delay between a change in fuel flow setting and the development of torque. \\[T_\\mathrm{eng}\\] should be zero in all but special cases where this transport delay is of particular concern [3].\nThe switch \\[W_\\mathrm{fspd}\\] is responsible for recognizing whether fuel flow, for a given fuel valve stroke, is be proportional to engine speed [3]. If True, fuel flow is proportional to speed. This is applicable for some gas turbines and diesel engines with positive displacement fuel injectors. If false, the fuel control system keeps fuel flow independent of engine speed.\n\nSpeed sensitivity / Damping\nIf \\[D_\\mathrm{m}=0\\], the speed sensitivity paths are not active. [3]\nIf \\[D_\\mathrm{m}&gt;0\\], it models friction losses (variation of the engine power with the shaft speed; slightly increasing losses with increasing speed are characteristic for reciprocating engines and some aeroderivative turbines [3]).\nIf \\[D_\\mathrm{m}=&lt;0\\], it can model an influence of rotation speed on exhaust temperature using an exponential characteristic determined by \\[D_\\mathrm{m}\\]. The maximum permissible fuel flow falls with falling speed (typical for single-shaft industrial turbines due to exhaust temperature limits) [3]. The authors suspect that this could represent fan cooling.\n\n\n\nFrequency dependent (valve) limit\nThe frequency-dependent limit block outputs the upper limit for valve position / the fuel flow signal fsr. It is shown in Figure 2.\nIn normal operation, the limit is \\[V_\\mathrm{max\\,\\omega} = V_\\mathrm{max}\\] and the there is no frequency dependent reduction.\nWhen the frequency \\[f\\] in Hz drops below \\[f_\\mathrm{lim\\,1}\\], the value for \\[P_\\mathrm{lim}\\], the power limit, is calculated by linear interpolation between the values \\[f_\\mathrm{lim\\,1}, f_\\mathrm{lim\\,2}, \\dots\\] and \\[P_\\mathrm{lim\\,1}, P_\\mathrm{lim\\,2}, \\dots\\] of a lookup table. The table consists of 10 data points which monotonically decrease in both power and frequency, point 1 being the hightest. The lowest data point does act as a lower limit, i.e. is not extrapolated to lower values.\n\\[V_\\mathrm{max\\,\\omega}\\] then ramps with the rate \\[P_\\mathrm{rate}\\] from the initial and maximum value to the new value \\[V_\\mathrm{max\\,omega} = (P_\\mathrm{lim} / K_\\mathrm{turb} + W_\\mathrm{fnl})\\].\n\\[P_\\mathrm{lim}\\] will then change with frequency. If f rises above \\[P_\\mathrm{lim\\,1}\\] again, \\[V_\\mathrm{max\\,\\omega}\\] ramps back to \\[V_\\mathrm{max}\\] [3].\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Frequency dependent valve limit as described in [3]\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\nPer-unit power parameters are based on \\[P_\\mathrm{base}\\], which is normally the capability of the turbine in MW. Per-unit frequency or acceleration parameters are based on the nominal frequency of the grid (e.g. 50 Hz in Europe).\n\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\nTable 1: Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\ntype\nunit e\nIEC name\ndescription\ntypical value\n\n\n\n\n\\[a_\\mathrm{set}\\]\nfloat\npu/s\nAset\nAcceleration limiter setpoint\n10\n\n\n\\[\\Delta\\omega_\\mathrm{db}\\]\nfloat\npu\ndb\nFrequency error deadband.

    "text": "This model consist of an ac alternator with either stationary or rotating rectifiers to produce the dc field requirements.Upgrades to earlier ac excitation systems, which replace only the controls but retain the ac alternator and diode rectifier bridge, have resulted in this new model.\nThis voltage regulator model first appeared in the IEEE Std 421.5-2016 {% cite IEEEExciterModels2016 %}. It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version {% cite IECCIMForDynamics2024 %}. In the previous standard version (2005), its predecessor model was called AC7B. Compared to AC7B, AC7C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs, and additional flexibility for the representation of the controlled rectifier power source.\n\n\n\nIt takes into account loading effects. It can’t allow the supply of negative field current. It takes into account saturation.\nThis model is satisfactory for large scale simulations. However, if this model is used to design phase lead networks for power system stabilizers, and the local mode is close to 3 Hz or higher, a more detailed treatment of the ac rotating exciter may be needed.\nExcitation systems incorporating rotating machines produce a field voltage output (\\[E_{FD}\\]) which is proportional to the rotating speed of the machine. Since this effect is negligible when speed deviations are small which is the case of dynamic studies of large interconnected power systems, the effect of speed deviations on the output of the dc rotating exciter models is not represented in this latest version of the standard. However, some commercial software may have implemented such speed dependency in their model.\n\n\n\nThe input variables are :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\nUnits\n\n\n\n\nIrPu\nrotor current\npu (base SNom, user-selected base voltage)\n\n\nitPu\ncomplex current at the terminal\npu (base SNom, UNom)\n\n\nUsPu\nmeasured stator voltage\npu (base UNom)\n\n\nUsRefPu\nreference stator voltage\npu (base UNom)\n\n\nutPu\ncomplex voltage at the terminal\npu (base UNom)\n\n\nUOelPu (optional)\noutput voltage of overexcitation limiter\npu (base UNom)\n\n\nUPssPu (optional)\noutput voltage of power system stabilizer\npu (base UNom)\n\n\nUSclOelPu (optional)\noutput voltage of stator current overexcitation limiter\npu (base UNom)\n\n\nUSclUelPu (optional)\noutput voltage of stator current underexcitation limiter\npu (base UNom)\n\n\nUUelPu (optional)\noutput voltage of underexcitation limiter\npu (base UNom)\n\n\n\nThe output signal is EfdPu, the excitation voltage in pu (user-selected base voltage).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\nUnits\n\n\n\n\nAEx\nGain of saturation function\npu\n\n\nBEx\nExponential coefficient of saturation function\n\n\n\nKc\nRectifier loading factor proportional to commutating reactance,\npu\n\n\nKc1\nRectifier loading factor proportional to commutating reactance (exciter),\npu\n\n\nKd\nDemagnetizing factor, function of exciter alternator reactances,\npu\n\n\nKdr\nRegulator derivative gain\npu\n\n\nKe\nExciter field resistance constant\npu\n\n\nKf1\nGenerator field voltage feedback gain\npu\n\n\nKf2\nExciter field current feedback gain\npu\n\n\nKf3\nRate feedback gain\npu\n\n\nKi\nPotential circuit (current) gaincoefficient\npu\n\n\nKia\nAmplifier integral gain\npu\n\n\nKir\nRegulator integral gain\npu\n\n\nKl\nExciter field current limiter gain\npu\n\n\nKp\nPotential source gain\npu\n\n\nKpa\nAmplifier proportional gain\npu\n\n\nKpr\nRegulator proportional gain\npu\n\n\nKr\nField voltage feedback gain\npu\n\n\nPositionOel\nInput location : (0) none, (1) voltage error summation, (2) take-over at AVR input, (3) take-over at AVR output, (4) take-over at inner loop regulator output\n-\n\n\nPositionPss\nInput location : (0) none, (1) voltage error summation, (2) after take-over UEL\n-\n\n\nPositionScl\nInput location : (0) none, (1) voltage error summation, (2) take-over at AVR input, (3) take-over at AVR output\n-\n\n\nPositionUel\nInput location : (0) none, (1) voltage error summation, (2) take-over at AVR input, (3) take-over at AVR output\n-\n\n\nSw1\nIf true, power source derived from terminal voltage, if false, independent from terminal voltage\n-\n\n\nSw2\nIf true, power source derived from available exciter field voltage, if false, from rotating exciter output voltage\n-\n\n\ntDr\nDerivative gainwashout time constant\ns\n\n\ntE\nExciter field time constant\ns\n\n\ntF\nRate feedback time constant\ns\n\n\nThetap\nPotential circuit phase angle\nrad\n\n\nTolLi\nTolerance on limit crossing as a fraction of the difference between initial limits of limited integrator\npu\n\n\ntR\nStator voltage filter time constant\ns\n\n\nVaMaxPu\nMaximum output voltage of limited PI\npu (user-selected base voltage)\n\n\nVaMinPu\nMinimum output voltage of limited PI\npu (user-selected base voltage)\n\n\nVbMaxPu\nMaximum available exciter field voltage\npu (base UNom)\n\n\nVeMinPu\nMinimum exciter output voltage\npu (user-selected base voltage)\n\n\nVfeMaxPu\nMaximum exciter field current signal\npu (user-selected base voltage)\n\n\nVrMaxPu\nMaximum output voltage of limited PID\npu (user-selected base voltage)\n\n\nVrMinPu\nMinimum output voltage of limited PID\npu (user-selected base voltage)\n\n\nXlPu\nReactance associated with potential source\npu (base SNom, UNom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAC7C\n\n\nWhere the AC rotating exciter model is modelled here\n\n\n\nIn the AC7B model :\n\nthere are no overexcitation limiter and no stator current limiter\nthe power system stabilizer and the underexcitation limiter output voltages are added to the voltage error\nthe available exciter field voltage is proportional to the absolute terminal voltage\n\n\n\n\nThis model has been successfully implemented in :\n\n\n\nSoftware\nURL\nLanguage\nOpen-Source License\nLast consulted date\nComments\n\n\n\n\nDynawo\nLink\nModelica\nMPL v2.0\n24/05/2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{% bibliography –cited –file references %}",

    "text": "It takes into account loading effects. It can’t allow the supply of negative field current. It takes into account saturation.\nThis model is satisfactory for large scale simulations. However, if this model is used to design phase lead networks for power system stabilizers, and the local mode is close to 3 Hz or higher, a more detailed treatment of the ac rotating exciter may be needed.\nExcitation systems incorporating rotating machines produce a field voltage output (\\[E_{FD}\\]) which is proportional to the rotating speed of the machine. Since this effect is negligible when speed deviations are small which is the case of dynamic studies of large interconnected power systems, the effect of speed deviations on the output of the dc rotating exciter models is not represented in this latest version of the standard. However, some commercial software may have implemented such speed dependency in their model.",

It will substitute the GENTPJ in December 2024 after the testing phase is finished, although it is already accepted by the WECC [3].",

Used in GE PSLF and PowerWorld Simulator.\nScaled Quadratic: \\[ Sat(x) = \\frac{B(x-A)^2}{x}\\]. Used in PTI PSS/E and PowerWorld Simulator.\nExponential: \\[ Sat(x) = Bx^A\\]. Used in BPA-IPF nad some specific models of PTI PSS/E and PowerWorld Simualtor.\n\nIn this case, the variable will be the magnetic flux \\[ S_a = Sat(\\Psi_{ag})\\] which is calculated using the air gap voltage as follows:\n\n\\[ \\Psi_{ag} = \\frac{1}{1+\\omega} \\sqrt(V_{qag}^2 + V_{dag}^2) \\] \\[ V_{qag} + V_q + I_qR_a + I_dX_l\\] \\[ V_{dag} + V_d + I_dR_a - I_dX_l\\]\n\nand then, the saturation of each axis is calculated as:\n\n\\[ Sat_d = Sat_q = 1 + S_a \\]\n\n\n\nScaling of the fluxes and reactances\nIn the GENTPJ, only the subtransient reactances were affected by the saturation effects.

    "text": "Physical description\nThe following schematic shows the components that participate in the synchronous machine operation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Synchronous machine model schematic\n\n\n\n\nPhysical parts of a Synchronous Machine\nA synchronous machine is formed by the following parts:\n\nRotor\nThe rotor is the moving part of the generator. It is at the end of the rotation axis of the turbine, which is the component that transfers the energy of a moving fluid (normally steam) into mechanical energy. As the name indicates, the mechanical energy corresponds to the rotational kinetic energy of the body composed by the blades and axis of the turbine.\nIt can be round rotor, commonly used in high rotation speed application, or salient pole, used in lower speed applications (i.e. hydro generation) where multiple pair of poles are needed to work at the grid frequency.[2] Both of them will have at least one winding revolving around an axis perpendicular to the rotating axis. The direction of the field produced by the DC excitation will rotate at the same rate as the rotor, pointing in the perpendicular direction of the rotating axis.\n\n\nExciter\nThe exciter is the source of power that generates the current flowing through the rotor winding. It applies a DC voltage that generates a current in the rotor winding, creating an electromagnet. It is important for voltage control as increasing the current supplied to the rotor winding increases the induced voltage in the stator winding, providing the ability to apply control loops that ensure the terminal voltage keeps at a setpoint.\nThis electromagnet can be replaced by a permanent magnet, in which case there would be no need to have a DC excitation to create a rotating field. These types of generators (PMSG), which can be found in newer models of wind turbines, have better efficiency as there are no losses associated with the excitation circuit, and lowers the maintenance needed since all the excitation parts are substituted by a single element. As a downside, there is no possibility to control the field by changing the level of excitation. The field magnitude will remain constant value, with a value dependent on the geometry and material of the magnet.\n\n\nStator\nIt is the static part of the machine, as its name indicates. This structure gives physical support to the whole machine, while it typically contains the armature winding. It is a three-phase winding distributed in a circular cavity 120º apart one from each other. The uniform rotation of the magnetic field created by the rotor winding will generate currents at each winding 120º apart in the phasorial space. The instantaneous value for each phase is noted as \\(i_a\\), \\(i_b\\), and \\(i_c\\). The following Figure [2] shows the structure of the synchronous machine, including the windings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Stator-rotor of a Synchronous Machine schematic\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernor\nThe governor is the controller of the speed of the motor. Its primary function is to maintain the speed of the rotor, and hence the frequency of the electrical output of the generator. It is necessary for adapting to load changes, since a sudden increase or decrease of the load would decelerate or accelerate the generator if no actions are taken. Since it is connected to the prime mover of the generator (generally a turbine), the control will adjust the amount of energy entering the turbine, increasing or decreasing the rate of energy as if it needs to accelerate or decelerate the rotation.\n\n\n\nSynchronous machine equations\n\nVariables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\ndetails\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta_{shaft}\\)\nRotor angle\n\\(rad\\)\n\n\n\\(\\omega\\)\nElectrical rotational speed\n\\(rad/s\\)\n\n\n\\(T_m\\)\nMechanical torque\n\\(Nm\\)\n\n\n\\(T_e\\)\nElectrical torque\n\\(Nm\\)\n\n\n\\(T_{fw}\\)\nWindage and friction torque\n\\(Nm\\)\n\n\n\\(v_a\\), \\(v_b\\), \\(v_c\\)\nStator phase voltages\n\\(V\\)\n\n\n\\(i_a\\), \\(i_b\\), \\(i_c\\)\nStator phase currents\n\\(A\\)\n\n\n\\(\\psi_a\\), \\(\\psi_b\\), \\(\\psi_c\\)\nStator phase flux linkages\n\\(Wb\\)\n\n\n\\(\\psi_f\\), \\(\\psi_{1d}\\), \\(\\psi_{1q}\\), \\(\\psi_{2q}\\)\nRotor flux linkages\n\\(Wb\\)\n\n\n\\(v_f\\)\nField voltage\n\\(V\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{ww'}\\)\nTotal inductance between two windings (can be itself)\n\\(H\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(J\\)\nMoment of inertia\n\\(kgm^2\\)\n\n\n\\(p_f\\)\nNumber of pole pairs\n-\n\n\n\\(R_a\\), \\(R_b\\), \\(R_c\\)\nStator phase resistances\n\\(\\Omega\\)\n\n\n\\(R_f\\), \\(R_{1d}\\), \\(R_{1q}\\), \\(R_{2q}\\)\nRotor windings resistances\n\\(\\Omega\\)\n\n\n\\(L_{ww0}\\)\nSelf-inductance of a winding\n\\(H\\)\n\n\n\\(L_{wl}\\)\nLeakage inductance of a winding\n\\(H\\)\n\n\n\\(L_{wg2}\\)\nMutual inductance between windings\n\\(H\\)\n\n\n\\(L_{af}\\)\nMutual inductance between stator and rotor\n\\(H\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem of equations\nThe following system of equations describe a general synchronous machine with the considered assumptions.

As it spins, the stator windings will be subjected to a variable magnetic flux caused by the rotation of the produced magnetic field which, according to Faraday’s Law, will induce an electromotive force in the windings.\n\n\\[e_{emf} = \\frac{d\\psi}{dt}\\]\n\nThe rotational speed of the rotor of a synchronous machine is proportional to the grid frequency times the number of poles (i.e. number of different three-phase windings). The induced field in each phase \\(e_{ir}\\) will lead the terminal voltage \\(v_i\\) by a load angle denoted as \\(\\delta\\).\n\n\\[n = \\frac{120f}{p_f} \\quad (2)\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the rotational speed in \\(rev/min\\), \\(f\\) is the stator currents frequency in \\(Hz\\), and \\(p_f\\) is the number of field poles.\nThe coupling between the rotor and the stator windings can be modelled using the terminal voltage equations:\n\n\\[v_a = R_a i_a + \\frac{d\\psi_a}{dt}\\] \\[v_b = R_b i_b + \\frac{d\\psi_b}{dt}\\] \\[v_c = R_c i_c + \\frac{d\\psi_c}{dt}\\] \\[v_f = R_f i_f + \\frac{d\\psi_f}{dt}\\] \\[v_{1d} = R_{1d} i_{1d} + \\frac{d\\psi_{1d}}{dt} \\] \\[v_{1q} = R_{1q} i_{1q} + \\frac{d\\psi_{1q}}{dt} \\] \\[v_{2q} = R_{2q} i_{2q} + \\frac{d\\psi_{2q}}{dt} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\psi_i\\) is the magnetic flux passing through the \\(i\\) winding in \\(Wb\\), \\(R_i\\) is the resistance of the associated circuit in \\(\\Omega\\), \\(v_i\\) is the terminal voltage in \\(V\\) and \\(i_i\\) is the current in \\(A\\).\nThe total fluxes are calculated taking into account all the present windings in the synchronous machine, which are the three stator windings and the rotor winding. The fluxes for all the windings are calculated as follows:\n\n\nStator fluxes:\n\n\\[\\psi_a = \\mathcal{L}_{aa} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{ab} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{ac} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{af} i_f + \\mathcal{L}_{a1d} i_{1d} + \\mathcal{L}_{a1q} i_{1q} + \\mathcal{L}_{a2q} i_{2q}\\] \\[\\psi_b = \\mathcal{L}_{ba} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{bb} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{bc} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{bf} i_f + \\mathcal{L}_{b1d} i_{1d} + \\mathcal{L}_{b1q} i_{1q} + \\mathcal{L}_{b2q} i_{2q}\\] \\[\\psi_c = \\mathcal{L}_{ca} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{cb} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{cc} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{cf} i_f + \\mathcal{L}_{c1d} i_{1d} + \\mathcal{L}_{c1q} i_{1q} + \\mathcal{L}_{c2q} i_{2q}\\]\n\nRotor fluxes:\n\n\\[\\psi_f = \\mathcal{L}_{fa} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{fb} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{fc} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{ff} i_f + \\mathcal{L}_{f1d} i_{1d}\\] \\[\\psi_{1d} = \\mathcal{L}_{1da} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{1db} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{1dc} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{1df} i_f + \\mathcal{L}_{1dqd} i_{1d}\\] \\[\\psi_{1q} = \\mathcal{L}_{1qa} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{1qb} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{1qc} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{1q1q} i_{1q} + \\mathcal{L}_{1q2q} i_{2q}\\] \\[\\psi_{2q} = \\mathcal{L}_{2qa} i_a + \\mathcal{L}_{2qb} i_b +\\mathcal{L}_{2qc} i_c + \\mathcal{L}_{2q1q} i_{1q} + \\mathcal{L}_{2q2q} i_{2q}\\]\n\nwith \\(\\mathcal{L}_{pp}\\) being the self inductance of the winding and \\(\\mathcal{L}_{pp'}\\) the mutual inductance between winding \\(p\\) and winding \\(p'\\), both in \\(H\\). As it can be seen, the q axis damper windings and the d axis damper and rotor windings do not interact since they are perpendicular.\nThe inductance values expressed using the notation \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) express a general dependency with respect to the rotor position \\(\\theta_{shaft} = \\omega t + \\theta_0\\) [4]. It is modelled as a sinusoidal dependency with respect to the electrical angle \\(\\theta_{me}\\). This angle can be calculated as a function of the rotor position angle expression seen before as \\(\\theta_{me} = \\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft} = \\omega_{me} t + \\theta_{e0}\\).\nThe general expression for mutual inductance would be \\[\\mathcal{L}_{pp} = L_{pp} = L_{pp0} + L_{pl} + L_{g2}\\cos(2\\theta_{me})\\] where the first term corresponds to the portion of the inductance due to the air gap, and the second term corresponds to the leakage flux. The mutual inductances, considering a perfect 120º separation between windings, and having \\(\\cos(120º) = -1/2\\) take the values \\(\\mathcal{L}_{pp'} = -\\frac{1}{2} L_{pp0} + L_{g2}\\cos(2\\theta_{me})\\).\nConsidering that all the windings are assumed to have the same characteristics, the inductances for the different phases will only differ in the angular term of the rotor position, which will have additional phase terms of \\((0º, 120º, -120º)\\) for phases \\((a, b, c)\\) respectively.\nThe stator-rotor inductance also depends on the electrical angle \\(\\theta_{me}\\) between the rotor winding axis and the stator winding axis. The value of this inductance for phase \\(a\\) can be calculated with the expression \\[\\mathcal{L}_{af} = \\mathcal{L}_{fa} = L_{af}\\cos(\\theta_{me})\\], while the same expression can be applied for phase \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) but replacing \\(\\theta_{me}\\) with \\(\\theta_{me} - 120º\\) and \\(\\theta_{me} + 120º\\) respectively.\n\n\n\nOperational limits\nDepending on the difference in phase between the rotor and grid rotation, the power transferred will be composed of active (\\(P\\)) and reactive (\\(Q\\)) power.\nThese generated powers are limited by the heat limits of the components of the generator. The limits considered are the Armature and field current limit, due to Joule effect heating of both windings, and end region heating limit, which occurs due to currents in the structure of the stator when the field is underexcited.\nThe following charts show the capability and compound curves for different power factors[1].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Capability curve of a Synchronous Generator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Compound curves of a Synchronous Generator\n\n\n\n\nThe left chart shows the \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) maximum values for different limit curves, which depend on the refrigerator used, while the right chart shows the dependency on exciter current and apparent power for different values of the power factor.",

    "text": "Outputs\nTo verify the correct setpoint tracking operation, we proceed to check the different controlled magnitudes of the simulation. Firstly, the plots for the DC voltage are shown at both ends of the DC link:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: DC voltage at the Grid Following side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: DC voltage at the Grid Forming side.\n\n\nAs shown in both figures, the DC voltage is correctly tracked by the DC voltage controls at the Grid Following side, reaching the desired value of 1.5 kV after a transient period. The Grid Forming side follows the same progression, although uncontrolled and falling slightly below the rated voltage due to the voltage drop of the link, as expected.\nThe reactive power exchanged with the grid in the Grid Following side is also shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Reactive power exchanged with the grid at the Grid Following side.\n\n\nInitially, no reactive power is exchanged, but after the setpoint change at 0.5 seconds, the reactive power is increased to 0.46 MVAr, as expected.\nLastly, the active power exchanged at both converters can be seen in the following figures:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Active power exchanged with the grid at the Grid Following side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Active power exchanged with the load at the Grid Forming side.\n\n\nWe can see that the active power exchanged in both sides is slightly lower than the expected (1 MW or 1.5 MW). This is due to the characteristics of the load, which is a constant impedance load. The value of this impedance is calculated using the nominal values for voltage and power, and since there is a voltage drop from the converter to the load, the exchanged power is lower than the nominal value.",

    "text": "Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations\nThe model is used to perform transient stability analysis of synchronous machines, providing a more accurate representation of the physical machine. It considers that there exists saturation in the iron of the machine, and it is applied to all the inductive terms simultaneously, differently to what the GENROU/GENSAL models with additive saturation consider. Following a recommendation note from the North-America Electrical Reliability Corporation (NERC) [4], the GENTPJ is overall recommended for all the synchronous machines as it recognizes the effect of the stator current in saturation. The GENROU, GENSAL and GENTPF (the latter being exactly identical to the GENTPJ except an additive term in the saturation function) may induce significant error specially in simulations where reactive power support is considered.\nThe model assumptions are the following:\n\nThe three-phase system is balanced.\nThe air gap between the stator and rotor is non-uniform, but the relationships between the flux linkages and currents are independent of the position of the rotor when expressed in the dq0 reference frame.\nThe magnetic circuit is considered to be non-linear, considering saturation effects, and can be modeled using different saturation functions.\nThe saturation effects are applied to the subtransient reactances, but not at the transient and steady-state reactances.\n\nThe GENTPJ model is suitable for EMT as it models with detail the non-linearities and the fast dynamics of the machine. However, the saturation effects are only applied to the subtransient reactances. Newer models consider saturation in more reactances of the machine, improving GENTPF and GENTPJ models. GENTPJ will be deprecated in December 2024, and substituted by the GENQEC [5], although this later model is still in testing process [6].",

    "text": "Operational principles\n\nModelling saturation\nTo model the saturation, there are three commonly used functions:\n\nQuadratic: \\[ Sat(x) = B(x-A)^2\\]. Used in GE PSLF and PowerWorld Simulator.\nScaled Quadratic: \\[ Sat(x) = \\frac{B(x-A)^2}{x}\\]. Used in PTI PSS/E and PowerWorld Simulator.\nExponential: \\[ Sat(x) = Bx^A\\]. Used in BPA-IPF nad some specific models of PTI PSS/E and PowerWorld Simualtor.\n\nIn this case, the variable will be the magnetic flux and, for the GENTPJ, the currents \\(I_d\\) and \\(I_q\\).\n\nDiference between GENTPF and GENTPJ\nThe model presented has two different approaches to include the saturation, which results in two slightly different models, the GENTPF and the GENTPJ. The only difference is an additive term that models the effect of the field current. The following equations are used to calculate the saturation over the q and d axis:\n\n\\[ Sat_d = 1 + Sat(\\Psi_{ag} + K_{is}\\sqrt(I_d^2 + I_q^2))\\] \\[ Sat_q = 1 + \\frac{X_q}{X_d}Sat(\\Psi_{ag} + K_{is}\\sqrt(I_d^2 + I_q^2))\\]\n\nwhere \\[K_{is}\\] is a given parameter that models the stator current effect. In the GENTPF, \\[K_{is} = 0\\], disregarding the effect to simplify the model, while the GENTPJ, with \\[K_{is} \\ne 0\\], is the more complete model and generally the one recommended using in transient stability studies.\nThis saturation factor will be used to multiply the flux values or to divide the reactance values.\n\n\n\nTransformation of the GENSAL model\nStarting form the GENSAL equations, the GENTPJ model is derived with detail in the PowerWorld document [3]. The most important aspects are covered in this section.\n\nSubtransient reactances\nWhen adding saturation in the GENSAL model, it is necessary to set \\[X_d'' = X_q''\\] to avoid transient saliency and then having a simple circuit equation could be used to model the grid connection. It was convenient to simplify the models back in the days, but it did not model properly the real behavior of the synchronous machine.\nFor the GENTPF/GENTPJ, generally \\[ X_d'' \\ne X_q''\\], which results in some more complex equations, but it allows to consider the impact of the transient saliency. The following expressions are used to calculate the saturated values of the reactances:\n\n\\[ X_{dsat}'' = \\frac{X_d'' - X_l}{Sat_d} + X_l \\] \\[ X_{qsat}'' = \\frac{X_q'' - X_l}{Sat_q} + X_l \\]\n\n\n\nNetwork interface equations\nThe following circuit equations were obtained in the GENSAL model:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{\\omega_s} \\frac{d\\Psi_d}{dt} = R_s I_d + \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s} \\Psi_q + V_d\\] \\[ \\frac{1}{\\omega_s} \\frac{d\\Psi_q}{dt} = R_s I_q - \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s} \\Psi_d + V_q\\]\n\nWith proper transformations using the expressions for the fluxes, they can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ V_d = - R_s I_d +  X_q''I_q + E_d''\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s}\\] \\[ V_q = - R_s I_q -  X_d''I_d + E_q''\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s}\\]\n\nwith \\[E_d'' = E'_d \\frac{X_q'' - X_l}{X_q' - X_l} + \\Psi_q'' \\frac{X_q' - X_q\"}{X_q' - X_l} \\], and \\[E_q'' = E'_q \\frac{X_d'' - X_l}{X_d' - X_l} + \\Psi_d'' \\frac{X_d' - X_d\"}{X_d' - X_l} \\], and where the scaling \\[\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s}\\] is ommited for the subtransient reactances. As discussed for the GENSAL model, \\[X_d'' = X_q''\\], which allows to compact the grid interface equations in a single equation:\n\n\\[ V_d + jV_q = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s} (E_d'' + jE_q'') - (R_s + jX_d'') (I_d + jI_q) \\]\n\nThis is not doable in the GENTPJ model, since generally the subtransient reactances are not equal. In this case, the saturated values of the subtransient reactance are used:\n\n\\[ V_d = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s} E_d'' + I_q X_{qsat}'' - I_dR_a\\] \\[ V_q = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_s} E_q'' - I_d X_{dsat}'' - I_qR_a\\]\n\nAgain, the frequency factor can be added to the term \\[I_q X_{qsat}''\\] and \\[I_d X_{dsat}''\\], but it is commonly omitted in transient stability studies.\nThe following figure shows the block diagram for this GENTPJ model [3]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Block diagram of the GENTPJ model",

    "text": "Operational principles\nThe general synchronous machine model contains the differential equations that completely model a round-rotor synchronous machine in the abc reference frame. In machines with salient poles rotors, the magnetic flux will have a preferred direction which will correspond to the salient part of the rotor. In the abc system, this preferred direction will be rotating alongside the rotor. This would translate in all the inductance values to be dependent on the position of the rotor as follows:\n\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_{pp} = L_{pl} + L_{pp0} + L_{g2}\\cos(p_f\\theta_{shaft}) \\] \\[\\mathcal{L}_{pp'} = -\\frac{1}{2}L_{pp0} + L_{g2}\\cos(p_f\\theta_{shaft}) \\] \\[\\mathcal{L}_{pf} = \\mathcal{L}_{fp} = L_{pf}\\cos(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft} + \\phi_p)\\]\n\nwith \\(p\\) and \\(p'\\) being two differen phases, and \\(\\phi_p\\) being the associated displacement for each phase. Applying these new inductance values to the flux equations yield a much more complicated form that cannot be simplified (the complete flux equations can be seen in Kundur’s book [1]).\nIn order to have simpler equations for the salient poles machines (and simplify even more the previous round-rotor model), there is a transformation to a reference frame that rotates with the rotor called the dq0 reference frame, also called the Park transformation. This reference frame is formed by the direct axis (d), which is the polar axis in which the permeance to the magnetic field is greater than the permeance along the interpolar axis, called quadrature axis (q). In this reference frame, inductance expressions no longer are a function of the rotor position, yielding much simpler flux expressions.\nThe following diagram shows the convention for the reference frame as described in [6], which is the most common convention used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Salient pole synchronous machine schematic\n\n\n\nAs it can be seen, in addition to the field winding, the model considers three more windings \\[(1d, 1q, 2q)\\] that act as dampers, and do not have electrical connections. The transformation for stator currents is the following:\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix} i_d \\\\\\ i_q \\\\\\ i_0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{2}{3} \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft}) & \\cos(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft} - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) & \\cos(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft} + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) \\\\\\ -\\sin(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft}) & -\\sin(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft} - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) & -\\sin(\\frac{p_f}{2}\\theta_{shaft} + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) \\\\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} i_a \\\\\\ i_b \\\\\\ i_c \\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nAn expression that is applicable to all the stator quantities such as voltage or flux. The zero-sequence current is always 0 in three-phase balanced conditions.\nThe transformation can be applied to the stator currents and fluxes equations from the general model while using the new inductance values. This derivation is omitted as it is laborious (it can be consulted in [1] or [5]). The flux expressions in the dq0 reference frame are:\n\n\\[\\psi_d = L_d i_d + L_{af} i_f \\] \\[\\psi_q = L_q i_q \\] \\[\\psi_f = \\frac{3}{2} L_{af} i_d + L_{ff} i_f \\] \\[\\psi_0 = L_0 i_0 \\]\n\nwith new inductance terms \\[L_d = L_{al} + \\frac{3}{2}(L_{aa0} + L_{g2})\\], \\[L_q = L_{al} + \\frac{3}{2}(L_{aa0} - L_{g2})\\] and \\[L_0 = L_{al}\\], all of them independent from the rotor position in this reference frame.\nNow, the voltage equations for the dq0 reference frame are also transformed into:\n\n\\[v_d = R_a i_d + \\frac{d\\psi_d}{dt} - \\omega \\psi_q \\] \\[v_q = R_a i_q + \\frac{d\\psi_q}{dt} + \\omega \\psi_d \\] \\[v_0 = R_a i_0 + \\frac{d\\psi_0}{dt}\\] \\[v_f = R_f i_f + \\frac{d\\psi_f}{dt}\\] \\[v_{1d} = R_{1d} i_{1d} + \\frac{d\\psi_{1d}}{dt}\\] \\[v_{1q} = R_{1q} i_{1q} + \\frac{d\\psi_{1q}}{dt}\\] \\[v_{2q} = R_{2q} i_{2q} + \\frac{d\\psi_{2q}}{dt}\\]\n\nThe expressions for instantaneous power and torque in this reference frame are [1]:\n\n\\[p_s (t) = \\frac{3}{2}(v_d i_d + v_q i_q + 2v_0 i_0)\\] \\[T_{mech} = \\frac{3}{2}(\\psi_d i_q + \\psi_q i_d)\\frac{p_f}{2}\\]\n\nThe full model of the synchronous generation can be written in a per-unit system as defined in Sauer and Pai book [6]. Firstly, the displacement with respect to the synchronous speed is defined as \\[\\delta = \\frac{p_f}{2} \\theta_{shaft} - \\omega_s t\\], where \\[\\omega_s = 2\\pi f\\] is the synchronous speed. If the rotor is rotating at the same speed as the grid, this angle will be constant. The displacement is:\n\n\\[\\frac{d\\delta}{dt} = \\omega_m - \\omega_s\\]\n\nThen, all the variables are scaled with respect to the rated values as follows:\n\n\\[ V_{abc} = \\frac{v_{abc}}{V_{BABC}}\\] \\[ I_{abc} = \\frac{-i_{abc}}{I_{BABC}}\\] \\[ \\Psi_{abc} = \\frac{\\psi_{abc}}{\\psi_{BABC}}\\] \\[ V_{dq0} = \\frac{v_{dq0}}{V_{BDQ}}\\] \\[ I_{dq0} = \\frac{-i_{dq0}}{I_{BDQ}}\\] \\[ \\Psi_{dq0} = \\frac{\\psi_{dq0}}{\\psi_{BDQ}}\\]\n\nwhere \\(V_{BABC}\\) and \\(V_{BDQ}\\) are the rated RMS phase to neutral voltage and peak phase to neutral voltage respectively, \\[I_{ABC} = \\frac{S_B}{3V_{ABC}}\\], \\[ I_{BDQ} = \\frac{2S_B}{3V_{BDQ}}\\] with \\(S_{B}\\) the rated three-phase apparent power, and \\[\\psi_{BABC} = \\frac{V_{BABC}}{\\omega_B}\\], \\[\\psi_{BDQ} = \\frac{V_{BDQ}}{\\omega_B}\\] with \\(\\omega_B = \\omega_s\\).\nThe rest of parameters can also be scaled as follows:\n\n\\[ R_{a} = \\frac{r_{a}}{Z_{BDQ}}\\] \\[ R_{f} = \\frac{r_{f}}{Z_{BFD}}\\] \\[ R_{1d} = \\frac{r_{1d}}{Z_{B1D}}\\] \\[ R_{1q} = \\frac{r_{1q}}{Z_{B1Q}}\\] \\[ R_{2q} = \\frac{r_{2q}}{Z_{B2Q}}\\]\n\nSimilar transformations can be performed over the rotor and stator inductances, which can be consulted in Sauer and Pai book [6], Sections 3.3 and 3.4.\nThe resulting equations for the synchronous machine model in the dq0 reference frame describe the GENSAL synchronous machine model without saturation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{\\omega_s} \\frac{d\\Psi_d}{dt} = R_s I_d + \\frac{\\omega_m}{\\omega_s} \\psi_q + V_d\\] \\[ \\frac{1}{\\omega_s} \\frac{d\\Psi_q}{dt} = R_s I_q - \\frac{\\omega_m}{\\omega_s} \\psi_d + V_q\\] \\[ \\frac{1}{\\omega_s} \\frac{d\\Psi_0}{dt} = R_s I_0 + V_0\\] \\[ T'_{d0} \\frac{dE'_q}{dt} = -E'_q - (X_d - X'_d)[I_d - \\frac{X'_d - X''_d}{(X'_d - X_{ls})^2} (\\Psi_{1d} + (X'_d - X_{ls})I_d - E'_q)] + E_{fd}\\] \\[ T''_{d0} \\frac{d\\Psi_{1d}}{dt} = -\\Psi_{1d} + E'_q - (X'_d - X_{ls})I_d\\] \\[ T'_{q0} \\frac{dE'_d}{dt} = -E'_d + (X_q - X'_q)[I_q - \\frac{X'_q - X''_q}{(X'_q - X_{ls})^2} (\\Psi_{2q} + (X'_q - X_{ls})I_q + E'_d)]\\] \\[ T''_{q0} \\frac{d\\Psi_{2q}}{dt} = -\\Psi_{2q} - E'_d - (X'_q - X_{ls})I_q\\] \\[ \\frac{d\\delta}{dt} = \\omega_m - \\omega_s\\] \\[ \\frac{2H}{\\omega_s} \\frac{d\\omega_m}{dt} = T_m - (\\Psi_d I_q - \\Psi_q I_d) - T_{fw}\\] \\[ \\Psi_d = -X''_d I_d + (\\frac{X'_d - X_{ls}}{X'_d - X_{ls}}) E'_q + (\\frac{X'_d - X''_d}{X'_d - X_{ls}}) \\Psi_{1d}\\] \\[ \\Psi_q = -X''_q I_q - (\\frac{X'_q - X_{ls}}{X'_q - X_{ls}}) E'_d + (\\frac{X'_q - X''_q}{X'_q - X_{ls}}) \\Psi_{2q}\\] \\[ \\Psi_0 = -X_{ls} I_0\\]",

It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version {% cite IECCIMForDynamics2024 %}. In previous standard versions (1992, 2005), its predecessor model was called AC6A. Compared to AC6A, AC6C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs.\n\n\n\nIt is used to represent field-controlled alternator-rectifier excitation systems with system-supplied electronic voltage regulators. It takes into account loading effects. It can’t allow the supply of negative field current. It takes into account saturation.\nThis model is satisfactory for large scale simulations.

Use of simpler models that do not accurately capture dynamic performance in the 0.1 Hz to 1 Hz frequency range can lead to errors in stability studies where inter‐area oscillations are a concern.

    "text": "Model description\n\nTurbine model\nThe turbine model is the mechanical part of the model with boiler, high pressure (HP) turbine and low pressure (LP) turbine [4]. Its output is the mechanical power \\[P_\\mathrm{m}\\]. A schematic representation of a steam turbine with HP and LP part is shown in Figure 2. The HP stage’s single-triangle symbol and the LP stage’s double-triangle symbol represent the fact that in the HP stage steam expands in only one direction whereas in the LP stage it expands in two directions [5].\n\nBoiler\nThe boiler is responsible for converting water into high-pressure, high-temperature steam. In normal operation \\[P_\\mathrm{set}\\] is used as the boiler set-point \\[P_\\mathrm{set\\,boiler}\\], i.e. the heat supplied to the boiler. In over speed situation, the emergency speed control signal is used instead, see Section 4.2.3.\nThe boiler output, i.e. the amount of steam supplied from the boiler to the turbine, is manipulated by the control valves [4].\n\n\nHigh-Pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) turbine stages\nThe HP and LP stages are modeled by a first order elements and gains \\[T_\\mathrm{hp}\\], \\[K_\\mathrm{hp}\\] and \\[T_\\mathrm{lp}\\], \\[K_\\mathrm{lp}\\].\nSteam power from the boiler enters the HP stage and is partly converted into mechanical power. The steam output from the HP stage then enters the reheater. Because the HP stage’s dynamic response is relevant here, the output of the \\[T_\\mathrm{hp}\\] lag element is used as input, but without the gain \\[K_\\mathrm{hp}\\].\nBefore entering the LP stage, the output steam from the HP stage must be reheated to prevent any water droplets from entering and to increase efficiency. The reheater is also modeled by a first order element with time constant \\[T_\\mathrm{rh}\\].\nFrom there the reheated steam passes the intercept valve and enters the LP stage. Here, the first order element directly contains the gain \\[K_\\mathrm{lp}\\], because only the generated power is of interest (the dynamic behaviour of the steam flow without gain is not necessary because there is no other following turbine stage) [4].\nThe mechanical power output \\[P_\\mathrm{m}\\] is the sum of the parts generated by the HP and LP turbine stages. To accurately represent this distribution, the gains for the HP and LP turbine stages must satisfy the following condition:\n\\[K_\\mathrm{hp} + K_\\mathrm{lp}  = 1\\]\n\n\n\nControl paths\nThe governor controller is responsible for regulating the steam flow to maintain the desired turbine speed or power output. It consists of two primary control paths [4], island and grid connected mode. They output the setpoint of the control valve’s position.\n\nIsland mode (\\[\\omega\\]-part)\nIn island mode, the input is the turbine’s rotational speed \\[\\omega\\]. It operates without connection to any external power grid, with the primary goal of maintaining a constant turbine speed. To achieve this, the measured turbine speed \\[\\omega\\] is subtracted from the reference speed \\[\\omega_\\mathrm{ref}\\] to obtain the error signal \\[\\Delta\\omega\\]. After passing the dead-band \\[\\Delta \\omega_\\mathrm{db}\\], it is used as input for the proportional \\[K_\\mathrm{\\omega\\,cor}\\] [4] [6].\nThe output of the island mode does not pass through the electrohydraulic transducer because it is an analog/mechanical controller, whereas the output of the PID controller of the grid connected mode is an electric signal.\n\n\nGrid connected mode (\\[f\\]-part)\nIn grid connected mode, the input is the measured electrical frequency \\[f\\]. The plant is linked to an upstream grid and contributes to overall grid stability. Here, frequency control is achieved through collective behavior; individual output adjustments are made via droop regulation.\nThis is implemented via a proportional gain \\[K_\\mathrm{f\\,cor}\\] with dead-band \\[\\Delta f_\\mathrm{db}\\] contributing to the power set-point \\[P_\\mathrm{set}\\]. The measured power \\[P_\\mathrm{e}\\] is then subtracted to obtain the error signal \\[\\Delta f\\] of the PID controller [4] [6].\n\n\nEmergency speed control and intercept valve (IV)\nEmergency speed control\nIn case of loss of loads, the turbine speed instantly begins to increase. Ideally, the governor is able to handle such fluctuations and reduces the control valve set-point fast enough. If not, an emergency speed control is activated to reduce the active power output of the turbine fast.\nThe Emergency Speed Control block in Figure 1 outputs 1 if \\[\\omega &lt; \\omega_\\mathrm{max\\,1}\\] and 0 if \\[\\omega &gt; \\omega_\\mathrm{max\\,2}\\]. In-between it interpolates between 1 and 0. This output is supposed to be below 1 or equal to 0 if \\[\\omega\\] reaches dangerous levels (dangerous for mechanical stability of the turbine). It is then passed to the two different low value select blocks (min()).\nThis has the effect of reducing the control valve and boiler set-points (\\[P_\\mathrm{set\\,ctrl}\\], \\[P_\\mathrm{set\\,boiler}\\]) fast, independently of what the controllers and the power set-point \\[P_\\mathrm{set}\\] do.\nThis fast reduction of \\[P_\\mathrm{set\\,ctrl}\\] also affects the intercept valve model, see below.\nIntercept valve (IV)\nIntercept valves remain fully open (set-point and position = 1) for regular speed/load adjustments [4]. In overspeed situations, the intercept valve shall close quickly and then reopen once normal conditions are restored.\nIn this model, the intercept valve set-point is generated by the intercept valves set-point generation block. The input is the control valves input signal.\nIf the control valve set-point \\[P_\\mathrm{set\\,ctrl}\\] is above \\[P_\\mathrm{simx}\\], the output is 1. If \\[P_\\mathrm{set\\,ctrl}\\] drops below, the output is reduced linearly until it reaches 0. In other implementations, a step to 0 is used instead of linear reduction as shown in the Figure 1 from [1].\nIn combination with the emergency speed control block, this leads to a fast reduction of the intercept valve set-point in case of over speed and hence interrupting the steam flow into the LP turbine and quickly reducing \\[P_\\mathrm{m}\\].\n\n\n\nBoiler set-point and control valve set-point coordination\nWhen the power set-point \\[P_\\mathrm{set}\\] changes, it influences the feed-forward control of the boiler, which has a slow response time, and the PID controller that manages the control valve, which reacts more quickly. By implementing the control valve signal multiplication within the first-order element representing the boiler, the feed-forward and PID controls work in harmony rather than opposition, allowing the system to reach a steady state that reflects the new \\[P_\\mathrm{set}\\].",

    "section": "2 Writing principles",
    "text": "2 Writing principles\nDepending on the nature of the page, the model or the test case template should be used. in both cases, the writing principles are the same.\n\n2.1 Title\nPlease refer to chapter 2 part A of the (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023)\n\n\n2.2 Tags\nAll pages should contain tags, which are keywords provided by the author and that will automatically be detected by the search function of the website. The tags are listed after the tag keyword in the Markdown metadata block.\n\n\n2.3 Nomenclature\nWhen nomenclature is needed, it should appear in a decicated section of the page, preferably at the beginning of the page.\n\n\n2.4 Equations\nWhen the equation is at the beginning of an item, align the equal sign with the right-hand side capitals, end the equation with a period, begin the definition with a capital, and end with a period.\nWhen the equation is at the end of an item, end the definition with a comma, follow with an equal sign and the rest of the equation, then end with a period as shown in the following example.\nConsecutive Numbering: Equations within an article are numbered consecutively from the beginning of the article to the end. Appendix Equations: Continued consecutive numbering of equations is best in the Appendix, but equation numbering that starts over with (A1), (A2), etc., for Appendix equations is permissible.\nMaterial in displayed equations is automatically italic unless you indicate otherwise. Some simple general rules apply. All variables are italic. Function names and abbreviations are Roman, as are units, unit abbreviations, complete words, and abbreviations of words. Superscripts and subscripts follow this same formula: when they are variables, they are italic; when they are abbreviations of words (such as “in” and “out” for input and output), they are Roman. Single-letter superscripts and subscripts may be italic even if they are abbreviations, unless this leads to inconsistency between italic and Roman characters for similar types of subscripts.\n\n\n2.5 References\nPlease consult the decicated section on references and other types of Papers in (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.6 Text citation of Figures and Tables\nPlease consult the decicated section on text citations of Figures and Tables in (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.7 Other text\nPlease consult the decicated section on inclusive language, footnotes, and lists in text in (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.8 Writing style\nPlease consult the decicated section on : Acronyms, spelling, trademarks, plurals, hyphenation rules, grammar, contractions, capitalization, Dates, percentages and decimals, Ranges wit units in chapter E. Writing Style for Transactions in (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.9 Grammar and usage\nFor guidance in grammar and usage, please consult the (The Chicago Manual of Style 2017) and Chapter III. Grammer and usage in transactions from (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.10 Mathematical editing\nPlease consult the (IEEE Editing Mathematics 2023) for guidelines on how to write mathematics.\n\n\n2.11 Electrical and Electronics Terms, notations and conventions\nPlease consult the (“IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms” 1996) for the terms to be used in Electrical and Electronics fields.\nFor notations and conventions, please look at this page\nFor electrical and eletronic diagram, you can refer to (Graphic Symbols for Electrical and Electronics Diagrams 1993) and (“American National Standard - Supplement to Graphic Symbols for Electrical and Electronics Diagrams” 1986)\nFor control terminology, you can check: (Terminological Dictionary of Automatic Control, Systems and Robotics 2024)",
