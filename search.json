The tags are listed after the tag keyword in the Markdown metadata block.\n\n\n2.3 Nomenclature\nWhen nomenclature is needed, it should appear in a decicated section of the page, preferably at the beginning of the page.\n\n\n2.4 Equations\nWhen the equation is at the beginning of an item, align the equal sign with the right-hand side capitals, end the equation with a period, begin the definition with a capital, and end with a period.\nWhen the equation is at the end of an item, end the definition with a comma, follow with an equal sign and the rest of the equation, then end with a period as shown in the following example.\nConsecutive Numbering: Equations within an article are numbered consecutively from the beginning of the article to the end. Appendix Equations: Continued consecutive numbering of equations is best in the Appendix, but equation numbering that starts over with (A1), (A2), etc., for Appendix equations is permissible.\nMaterial in displayed equations is automatically italic unless you indicate otherwise. Some simple general rules apply. All variables are italic. Function names and abbreviations are Roman, as are units, unit abbreviations, complete words, and abbreviations of words. Superscripts and subscripts follow this same formula: when they are variables, they are italic; when they are abbreviations of words (such as “in” and “out” for input and output), they are Roman. Single-letter superscripts and subscripts may be italic even if they are abbreviations, unless this leads to inconsistency between italic and Roman characters for similar types of subscripts.\n\n\n2.5 References\nPlease consult the decicated section on references and other types of Papers in (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.6 Text citation of Figures and Tables\nPlease consult the decicated section on text citations of Figures and Tables in (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.7 Other text\nPlease consult the decicated section on inclusive language, footnotes, and lists in text in (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.8 Writing style\nPlease consult the decicated section on : Acronyms, spelling, trademarks, plurals, hyphenation rules, grammar, contractions, capitalization, Dates, percentages and decimals, Ranges wit units in chapter E. Writing Style for Transactions in (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.9 Grammar and usage\nFor guidance in grammar and usage, please consult the (The Chicago Manual of Style 2017) and Chapter III. Grammer and usage in transactions from (IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors 2023).\n\n\n2.10 Mathematical editing\nPlease consult the (IEEE Editing Mathematics 2023) for guidelines on how to write mathematics.\n\n\n2.11 Electrical and Electronics Terms, notations and conventions\nPlease consult the (“IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms” 1996) for the terms to be used in Electrical and Electronics fields.\nFor notations and conventions, please look at this page\nFor electrical and eletronic diagram, you can refer to (Graphic Symbols for Electrical and Electronics Diagrams 1993) and (“American National Standard - Supplement to Graphic Symbols for Electrical and Electronics Diagrams” 1986)\nFor control terminology, you can check: (Terminological Dictionary of Automatic Control, Systems and Robotics 2024)",
