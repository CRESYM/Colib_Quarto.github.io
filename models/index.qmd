## Dynamic Power System Models

The Colib library provides a comprehensive collection of **dynamic power system component models** designed for steady-state and dynamic stability studies. These models represent the mathematical equations and behaviors of various power system components, enabling accurate simulation of modern electric power networks.

### Model Categories

Our collaborative library organizes models into several key categories:

#### **Generation Models**
- **Synchronous Generators**: Classical, detailed, and simplified models with various excitation and governor systems
- **Renewable Energy Sources**: Wind turbines (Type 1-4), solar PV systems, and energy storage systems
- **HVDC Systems**: Line-commutated converters (LCC) and voltage-source converters (VSC)
- **Distributed Energy Resources (DER)**: Microgrids, battery storage, and aggregated models

#### **Network Models**
- **Transmission Lines**: Frequency-dependent and pi-equivalent models
- **Transformers**: Two-winding and three-winding with tap-changing capabilities
- **FACTS Devices**: SVC, STATCOM, TCSC, and UPFC models
- **Protection Systems**: Relay models and automatic switching devices

#### **Load Models**
- **Static Load Models**: Constant impedance, current, and power models
- **Dynamic Load Models**: Motor loads, composite loads, and voltage-dependent models
- **Smart Grid Components**: Demand response and flexible load models

### Model Development Approach
