# TGOV3 model

This article is incomplete, some sections must be written.

## Context

This governor model appears under the name GovSteamFV3 in the Common Information Model for Dynamics - Standard Models (2012) [@CIMStandardModels2012] and in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version [@IECCIMForDynamics2024].

## Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations

To be completed

## Model inputs and output

The input variables are :

| Variable | Description | Units |
|-----------|--------------| ------|
|$fastValving$ |a Boolean which, if true, initiates the fast valving|-|
|$\omega_{Pu}$ |measured angular frequency | $pu$ (base $\omega_{Nom}$)|
|$\omega_{RefPu}$ |reference angular frequency | $pu$ (base $\omega_{Nom}$)|
|$P_{mRefPu}$ |reference mechanical power | $pu$ (base $P_{NomTurb}$)|

The output signal is $P_{mPu}$, the mechanical power in $pu$ (base $P_{NomTurb}$).

## Model parameters

| Parameter | Description | Units |
|-----------|--------------| ------|
|$K$ |Governor gain(reciprocal of droop) |$pu$|
|$K_1$ |Fraction of HP shaft power after first boiler pass|-|
|$K_2$ |Fraction of LP shaft power after first boiler pass|-|
|$K_3$ |Fraction of HP shaft power after second boiler pass|-|
|$P_{MaxPu}$ |Maximum valve opening |$pu$ (base $P_{NomTurb}$)|
|$P_{MinPu}$ |Minimum valve opening |$pu$ (base $P_{NomTurb}$)|
|$P_{rMaxPu}$ |Maximum pressure in reheater |$pu$ (base $P_{NomTurb}$)|
|$t_1$ |Governor lag time constant |$s$ |
|$t_2$ |Governor lead time constant |$s$|
|$t_3$ |Valve positioner time constant |$s$|
|$t_4$ |Inlet piping / steam bowl time constant |$s$|
|$t_5$ |Time constant of second boiler pass (reheater) |$s$|
|$t_6$ |Time constant of crossover of third boiler pass |$s$|
|$t_A$ |Time to close intercept valve |$s$|
|$t_B$ |Time until intercept valve starts to reopen |$s$|
|$t_C$ |Time until intercept valve is fully open |$s$|
|$U_o$ |Maximum valve opening velocity |$pu/s$|
|$U_c$ |Maximum valve closing velocity |$pu/s$|
