# Exc IEEE ST5C model

This article is incomplete, some sections must be written.

## Context

This voltage regulator model first appeared in the IEEE Std 421.5-2016 [@IEEEExciterModels2016]. It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version [@IECCIMForDynamics2024].
In the previous standard version (2005), its predecessor model was called ST5B. Compared to ST5B, ST5C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs.

## Model inputs and output

The input variables are :

| Variable | Description | Units |
|-----------|--------------| ------|
|$I_r P_u$ |rotor current |${pu}$ (base $S_{Nom}$, user-selected base voltage)|
|$U_s P_u$ |measured stator voltage |${pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{s} R_{ef} P_u$ |reference stator voltage |${pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U O_{el} P_u$ (optional) |output voltage of overexcitation limiter |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|
|$U P_{ss} P_u$ (optional) |output voltage of power system stabilizer |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|
|$U S_{cl} O_{el} P_u$ (optional) |output voltage of stator current overexcitation limiter |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|
|$U S_{cl} U_{el} P_u$ (optional) |output voltage of stator current underexcitation limiter |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|
|$U U_{el} P_u$ (optional) |output voltage of underexcitation limiter |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|

The output signal is $E_{fd} P_u$, the excitation voltage in ${pu}$ (user-selected base voltage).

## Model variant

In the ST5B model :

- the overexcitation and underexcitation limitation voltages are applied at the AVR input
- there is no stator current limiter
