# Exc IEEE ST6C model

This article is incomplete, some sections must be written.

## Context

This voltage regulator model first appeared in the IEEE Std 421.5-2016 [@IEEEExciterModels2016]. It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version [@IECCIMForDynamics2024].
In the previous standard version (2005), its predecessor model was called ST6B. Compared to ST6B, ST6C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs and an additional block with time constant $t_A$.

## Model inputs and output

The input variables are :

| Variable | Description | Units |
|-----------|--------------| ------|
| $I_r P_u$ |rotor current |${pu}$ (base $S_{Nom}$, user-selected base voltage)|
|$i_t P_u$ |complex current at the terminal |${pu}$ (base $S_{Nom}$, $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_s P_u$ |measured stator voltage |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|
|$U_{s} R_{ef} P_u$ |reference stator voltage |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|
|$u_t P_u$ |complex voltage at the terminal |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|
|$U_{Oel} P_u$ (optional) |output voltage of overexcitation limiter |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|
|$U_{Pss} P_u$ (optional) |output voltage of power system stabilizer |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|
|$U_{Scl} O_{el} P_u$ (optional) |output voltage of stator current overexcitation limiter |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|
|$U_{Scl} U_{el} P_u$ (optional) |output voltage of stator current underexcitation limiter |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|
|$U_{Uel} P_u$ (optional) |output voltage of underexcitation limiter |${pu}$ (base $U N_{om}$)|

The output signal is $E_{fd} P_u$, the excitation voltage in ${pu}$ (user-selected base voltage).

## Model diagram

![ST6C block diagram](ST6C.drawio.svg){#fig-st6c-diagram}

## Model variant

In the ST6B model :

- the voltage from the underexcitation limiter is applied at the AVR input
- there is no stator current limiter
- the power source is derived from terminal voltage, with no reactance
- there is no first order filter on the feedback signal of the inner loop field regulator
