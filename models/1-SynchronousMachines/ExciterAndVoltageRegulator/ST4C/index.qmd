# Exc IEEE ST4C model

This article is incomplete, some sections must be written.

## Context

This voltage regulator model first appeared in the IEEE Std 421.5-2016 [@IEEEExciterModels2016]. It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version [@IECCIMForDynamics2024].
In the previous standard version (2005), its predecessor model was called ST4B. Compared to ST4B, ST4C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs, an additional block with time constant $t_A$ and an additional time constant $t_G$ in the feedback path with gain $K_g$.

## Model inputs and output

The input variables are :

| Variable | Description | Units |
|-----------|--------------| ------|
|$I_r$ |rotor current |$\text{pu}$ (base $S_{Nom}$, user-selected base voltage)|
|$i_t$ |complex current at the terminal |$\text{pu}$ (base $S_{Nom}$, $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_s$ |measured stator voltage |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{s,Ref}$ |reference stator voltage |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$u_t$ |complex voltage at the terminal |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{Oel}$ (optional) |output voltage of overexcitation limiter |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{Pss}$ (optional) |output voltage of power system stabilizer |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{Scl,Oel}$ (optional) |output voltage of stator current overexcitation limiter |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{Scl,Uel}$ (optional) |output voltage of stator current underexcitation limiter |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{Uel}$ (optional) |output voltage of underexcitation limiter |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|

The output signal is $E_{fd}$, the excitation voltage in $\text{pu}$ (user-selected base voltage).

## Model diagram

![ST4C block diagram](ST4C.drawio.svg){#fig-st4c-diagram}

## Model variant

In the ST4B model :

- the overexcitation limiter voltage is applied in the inner loop field regulator
- the voltages from the underexcitation limiter and the power system stabilizer are added to the voltage error
- there is no stator current limiter
- the power source is derived from terminal voltage
- there are no first order filter and no upper limit for the feedback signal of the inner loop field regulator
