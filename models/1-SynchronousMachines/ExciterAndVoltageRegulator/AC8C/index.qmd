# Exc IEEE AC8C model

## Context

This model is used to represent static voltage regulators applied to brushless excitation systems. Digitally based voltage regulators feeding dc rotating main exciters could also be represented with the AC8C model with the parameters $K_C$ and $K_D$ set to zero.

This voltage regulator model first appeared in the IEEE Std 421.5-2016 [@IEEEExciterModels2016]. It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version [@IECCIMForDynamics2024].
In the previous standard version (2005), its predecessor model was called AC7B. Compared to AC8B, AC8C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs, and additional flexibility for the representation of the controlled rectifier power source.

## Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations

It takes into account loading effects. It can't allow the supply of negative field current. It takes into account saturation.

This model is satisfactory for large scale simulations. However, if this model is used to design phase lead networks for power system stabilizers, and the local mode is close to 3 Hz or higher, a more detailed treatment of the ac rotating exciter may be needed.

Excitation systems incorporating rotating machines produce a field voltage output ($E_{FD}$) which is proportional to the rotating speed of the machine. Since this effect is negligible when speed deviations are small which is the case of dynamic studies of large interconnected power systems, the effect of speed deviations on the output of the dc rotating exciter models is not represented in this latest version of the standard. However, some commercial software may have implemented such speed dependency in their model.

## Model inputs and output

The input variables are :

| Variable | Description | Units |
|-----------|--------------| ------|
|$I_r$ | rotor current | $\text{pu}$ (base $S_{Nom}$, user-selected base voltage)|
|$i_t$ |complex current at the terminal |$\text{pu}$ (base $S_{Nom}$, $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_s$ |measured stator voltage |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{s,Ref}$ |reference stator voltage |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$u_t$ |complex voltage at the terminal |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{Oel}$ (optional) |output voltage of overexcitation limiter |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{Pss}$ (optional) |output voltage of power system stabilizer |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{Scl,Oel}$ (optional) |output voltage of stator current overexcitation limiter |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{Scl,Uel}$ (optional) |output voltage of stator current underexcitation limiter |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|
|$U_{Uel}$ (optional) |output voltage of underexcitation limiter |$\text{pu}$ (base $U_{Nom}$)|

The output signal is $E_{fd}$, the excitation voltage in $\text{pu}$ (user-selected base voltage).
