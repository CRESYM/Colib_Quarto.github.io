# AcRotatingExciter model

## Context

This ac rotating exciter with non-controlled rectifiers has been presented in details in [@Ferguson1960] and [@Gayek1964].

This model is included in the type AC (alternator-supplied rectifier) voltage regulator models described in the IEEE Std 421.5-2016 [@IEEEExciterModels2016], specifically those named AC.C (AC1C, AC6C, etc.). Compared to the first standard version (1992), the models AC.B (introduced in the second standard version of 2005) and AC.C have a variable upper limit for the limited integrator.

## Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations

This model is satisfactory for large scale simulations. However, if this model is used to design phase lead networks for power system stabilizers, and the local mode is close to 3 Hz or higher, a more detailed treatment of the ac rotating exciter may be needed.
Saturation is taken into account with $S_E(V_E)$

The demagnetizing effect of load current $I_{FD}$ on the exciter alternator output voltage $V_E$ is accounted for in the feedback path that includes the demagnetization constant $K_D$. This constant depends on of the exciter alternator synchronous and transient reactances.

## Model inputs and outputs

The output variables are :

| Variable | Description | Units |
|-----------|--------------| ------|
| $E_{fd}$ | excitation voltage | $\text{pu}$ (user-selected base voltage)|
| $V_{fe}$ | field current signal | $\text{pu}$ (user-selected base voltage)|
