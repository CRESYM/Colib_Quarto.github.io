:::{.callout-important}
_Do not provide the title here (to avoid duplicate display) as it should be included in the Metadata block. We recommend including the issue ID generated by Colib GitHub along with the title.  A test case includes a network test system with static and dynamic models for each element, some input data, and some scenarios.
 Each test case must be specific enough to be added in a new page. In other words, it means that the test case should be **significatively different from existing standard test cases** (either by its network topology, generation mix, static data values), either by its operating point, either by the phenomena/event it tackles. The **differences with existing well-known test cases should be clearly explained**.
:::


## Use case purpose​ and context (mandatory)

_This section aims at explaining the main purpose of the test case, the reason why it was built. The history behind the test case can also be given for clarity._

**Example**

The *Kundur two area system* is a test system for studies on dynamic stability, oscillations, damping, power exchange and other use cases. It is a widely used standard test case defined in @Kundur (@fig-KTA).


## Network ​description (mandatory)

_This section gives the overview of the network test system. A grid map, an electrical circuit diagram,  can be provided as well as some extra explanations of the network (chart labels, symbols, generation mix, consumption level, etc.)._

:::{.callout-note}
For electrical circuit diagram, we can use [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) plugin for github allowing you to make your own diagram easily. The diagram is fully editable with github commit using a graphical interface, and allowing multiple format outputs (for more details, see: [draw.io github](https://app.diagrams.net/))
If you want to use a picture, please use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format.
:::

**Example**

The test system is shown @fig-KTA. As @Kundur describes it, it consists of two similar areas connected by a weak tie.

The parameters are listed in @sec-inputData. The system consists of 11 buses connected by lines or transformers. There are 4 generators G1…G4, two loads L7 and L9 as well as two shunt capacitors C7 and C9.

## Static and Dynamic models​ description (mandatory)

_This section lists the different elements of the network test system._

:::{.callout-note}
To avoid moo much information on the same page, some links to the elements model's pages can be provided.
:::


**Example**

This test case includes the following components:
 [...]

#### AVRs

The following AVRs are used in this test system, depending on the used scenario:

- no AVR: Manual excitation, i.e. constant field voltage
- AVR DC1A (similar to DC1C, [see colib page here](https://colib.net/pages/models/regulations/avr/DC1C/))
  - $K_\mathrm{a}=$ 20 pu
  - $K_\mathrm{a}=$ 200 pu
- AVR ST1A (similar to ST1C, [see colib page here](https://colib.net/pages/models/regulations/avr/ST1C/))
  - (with/without transient gain reduction (TGR) and/or power system stabilizer (PSS))

For details on the scenarios, see [Section 6](#scenarios).

## Input Data (mandatory) {#sec-inputData}

_This section includes all the needed input data the test case needs to be run._
_It includes: static data for the network, dynamic data for each dynamic element component, load flow values, initial states of dynamic variables._

:::{callout-important}
If the network is too big, input data can be provided by uploading data files directly in the page. The data files should be understandable and contains unit information. Example: [Data](data.xlsx)
